On their third album&nbsp;<em>Evolve<\/em>, the Grammy Award-winning band shift perspective and take on a brighter but more layered emotional outlook. \"The last year's been the healthiest year of my life, and I think that's very much reflected in the music,\" says lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, whose bandmates include guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. \"There's definitely some moments of sadness on this album, but there's also moments of real celebration.\"<br \/> <br \/> Despite the minimalistic approach of&nbsp;<em>Evolve<\/em>, Imagine Dragons achieve a rich complexity partly informed by their taking time out to recharge. After much soul-searching during a year-long break from touring, the band arrived at a new mindset and ultimately brought a greater sense of openness to their music. \"<em>Smoke + Mirrors&nbsp;<\/em>was a very introspective time for the band, where we were questioning spirituality and its meaning in our lives,\" says Reynolds. Sermon continues: \"With that album we were struggling to come up with the answers, and with this one we're satisfied not to have the answers at all.\"<br \/> <br \/> Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them a grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER\/Interscope by hitmaking producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fanbase with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single \"It's Time\" (featured on the 2012 EP&nbsp;<em>Continued Silence<\/em>). With their past hits also including \"Radioactive\" (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see&nbsp;<em>Smoke + Mirrors<\/em>debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.<br \/> <br \/> For Imagine Dragons, one of the greatest achievements of&nbsp;<em>Evolve<\/em>&nbsp;is its unfettered honesty. \"Instead of hiding behind metaphors, I was able to be more direct in my lyrics,\" says Reynolds. \"I really focused on searching deeper for lyrical value.\" Along with giving the album untold emotional depth, honesty cuts through everyday chaos to reveal a luminous truth. \"Right now the world can seem like a very dark and daunting place,\" says Reynolds. \"We wanted to create something like a lot of the records we grew up on, where it feels like you're escaping into a world that's much more vibrant. Our hope is that the album helps people focus on the beauty of each moment, and really see all the brilliance and color of life.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ImagineDragons_11_50_13_AM_2_23_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 27 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 27","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ImagineDragons"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.imaginedragonsmusic.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Imaginedragons"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sENM2wA_FTg"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/imaginedragons\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/53XhwfbYqKCa1cC15pYq2q"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/imagine-dragons-milwaukee-wisconsin-06-27-2018\/event\/0700544DAE0D31B0?artistid=1435919&tm_link=tm_homeA_header_search"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:45 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"grace-vanderwaal":{"id":"3862","name":"Grace VanderWaal","friendly_url":"grace-vanderwaal","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>Hailed by <em>Rolling Stone<\/em> as a &ldquo;pop prodigy,&rdquo; Grace VanderWaal has staked a claim to be one of the most exciting names in music today. Upon skyrocketing to fame after winning the 11th season of NBC&rsquo;s top-rated <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent<\/em>, releasing the best-selling EP <em>Perfectly Imperfect<\/em> and her first full length album <em>Just The Beginning<\/em>, the ukulele-wielding VanderWaal is a singer-songwriter in the truest sense of the term with a distinct knack for capturing emotion while armed with her trademark smoky voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had so many amazing little moments so far,&rdquo; explains VanderWaal. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what&rsquo;s happened. There&rsquo;s no words.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Born in Kansas and raised in Rockland County, New York, VanderWaal auditioned with an original song for NBC&rsquo;s <em>America&rsquo;s Got Talent<\/em> on a whim. She subsequently charmed America, taking home the show&rsquo;s top prize and quickly signing a deal with Columbia Records and Simon Cowell&rsquo;s Syco Records, putting her on track to become one of Generation Z&rsquo;s brightest stars. &ldquo;Before <em>AGT<\/em>, I was just Grace,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;Then everything was flipped upside down. I never could have even dreamed I&rsquo;d win or that this was my destiny. I&rsquo;ve been taking it one step at a time ever since.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Grace was honored as the &ldquo;Rising Star&rdquo; at Billboard Women in Music and named one of <em>Billboard&rsquo;s<\/em> 21 Stars Under 21 for the second time, in addition to being recognized in Variety&rsquo;s Youth Impact Report. VanderWaal has delivered viral performances everywhere from <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show <\/em>to<em> The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, <\/em>as well as the opening ceremony of the 2017 Special Olympics. The young star has also become a monster presence on YouTube with two different channels where VanderWaal showcases her bright personality, regularly posting covers and originals to the delight of a combined two million subscribers. Proving to be a true social media sensation, her Instagram is filled with empowering messages about her day-to-day life and boasts two million followers, leading acclaimed modeling agency IMG to add her to their prestigious roster.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I look in the mirror, I don&rsquo;t see Grace VanderWaal: the singer. I just see me,&rdquo; says VanderWaal, who keeps her family close every step of the way (with her sister Olivia even pitching in on the artwork for her album and EP) and prides herself on living an otherwise normal life. It&rsquo;s all part of an overarching mission to use her incredible voice to empower young girls. &ldquo;You can go anywhere around the world, and in every culture there&rsquo;s some kind of music,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Something about a song has a special ability to touch your heart.&rdquo; Capitalizing on the bright spotlight of fame, the young singer founded Little Miracles, a charity named after her beloved fan base she launched with her <em>AGT<\/em> prize money with a mission to aid schools in need.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout it all, it&rsquo;s a cache of intensely personal music that endears her to fans around the world. &ldquo;The songs I write are based on my life experiences,&rdquo; VanderWaal says, who recently released her aptly-titled debut <em>Just The Beginning,<\/em> on which she wrote every track. Highly anticipated, the album features the current chart-topper &ldquo;Moonlight,&rdquo; which she co-wrote with Ido Zmishlany, known for his work with Shawn Mendes. (Other collaborators include pop heavy hitters ranging from Sean Douglas to Gregg Wattenberg). &ldquo;I channel whatever feelings I have into my lyrics, and if I feel in my heart that a song is right, then it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; says VanderWaal of her songwriting craft. &ldquo;My favorite part of it all is performing and seeing how my fans react to my music. I love being able to sing something I&rsquo;ve created.&rdquo; In support, VanderWaal just finished her sold-out cross-country headlining tour, and is now prepping to join Imagine Dragons on their US tour this summer.<\/p>\n<p>With the singer earning Best New Artist honors at both the <em>Radio Disney Music Awards <\/em>and <em>Teen Choice Awards <\/em>and<em> Billboard<\/em> noting that VanderWaal is &ldquo;definitely growing by leaps and bounds before our eyes,&rdquo; it all proves that this indeed is all merely the beginning for the budding star. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited for the future,&rdquo; says VanderWaal. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see what&rsquo;s next.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GraceVanderWaal_3_31_20_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"June 27 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"June 27","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GraceVanderWaalMusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gracevanderwaal\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3YdT8QvV4QvY4DfVJhxdcZ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gracevanderwaal"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/gracevanderwaal.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCqswuI3fsM4oQam6liOVJsw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/event\/0700544DAE0D31B0?CAMEFROM=CFC_SUMMERFEST_LINEUP&IMAGINEDRAGONS"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:44 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"james-taylor":{"id":"3743","name":"James Taylor","friendly_url":"james-taylor","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>As a recording and touring artist, James Taylor has touched people with his warm baritone voice and distinctive style of guitar-playing for more than 40 years, while setting a precedent to which countless young musicians have aspired.&nbsp; Over the course of his celebrated songwriting and performing career, Taylor has sold more than 100 million albums, earning gold, platinum, and multi-platinum awards for classics ranging from&nbsp;<em>Sweet Baby James<\/em>&nbsp;in 1970 to&nbsp;<em>October Road<\/em>&nbsp;in 2002.

Both onstage in front of thousands or alone in a room with his guitar, the North Carolina singer-songwriter knows who he is, where he comes from and where he wants to go. And on his debut album for River House Artists\/Columbia Nashville, <em>This One's for You<\/em>, he invites listeners to share in his remarkable journey.<\/p>\n<p>Like its title suggests, the album is a sincere offering of thanks: to his mom and dad who gave him his first guitar; to the friends who made up his first band; and especially to the fans who supported him since his humble days singing in restaurants in Boone, North Carolina. It was those very gigs, nightly three-hour marathons at eateries around the college town, that taught Luke how to grab &ndash; and hold &ndash; the attention of his audience.<\/p>\n<p>\"My strategy was if I could sing my ass off on cover songs like Skynyrd's 'Simple Man,' that'd get people to put their food down for a minute. Then I'd play an original song right after that and I'd have them,\" says Luke.<\/p>\n<p>The shrewd idea worked, and soon the young artist with a knack for crafting imagery-rich, real-life songs was building a solid fan base, one that would follow him to bars throughout North Carolina or online via the viral YouTube and Vine performance videos he posted. Aware that he was capturing lightning in a bottle, he assembled some of his most popular tracks for a series of successful EPs and, with their impressive sales, was able to finance a move to Nashville.<\/p>\n<p>Luke, who was working two \"mega brutal\" jobs, at a go-kart track and at an outlet store, gave his notice and split. \"I quit my jobs and haven't had one since,\" he says \"That was 'making it' to me.\"<\/p>\n<p>But the ballcap-and-boots singer is selling himself short, because the exceptional<\/p>\n<p><em>This One's for You <\/em>and its hit single \"Hurricane\" portend much more is to come.<\/p>\n<p>A collection of 12 songs all written by Luke, often with frequent collaborators Ray Fulcher and James McNair, <em>This One's for You <\/em>paints the most relatable of pictures. Songs like the driving \"Hurricane\" and the cautionary \"One Number Away\" capture the essence of heartbreak and bad decisions, while the winking \"When It Rains It Pours\" and boozy \"Beer Can\" celebrate life's little victories. In every song on the album, there's at least one lyric that will elicit a knowing \"I've been there\" from fans.<\/p>\n<p>And that's the other secret to Luke's grass-roots success. His fans see themselves reflected in both his songs and his everyguy demeanor. Just like them, he busts his back so he can appreciate even the smallest of luxuries.<\/p>\n<p>\"I'm a guy you can go have a beer with and not worry that I'm gonna talk about Maseratis and exotic vacations,\" he laughs, exuding a refreshing innocence. \"I would love to go to the Cayman Islands as much as the next guy, but I don't even have a passport. I had never been on a plane until I was 25. So the fans see I'm a lot like them. They see I'm working hard &ndash; especially with my songs. I didn't just go pick out a bunch of songs that I thought people would relate to.\"<\/p>\n<p>Instead, he lived them and harnessed those experiences for his lyrics. In the moody, vulnerable \"One Number Away,\" he's tempted with dialing those forbidden digits. \"How many people have ever had too much to drink and picked up their cellphone and called someone they shouldn't have?\" he asks. \"<em>Everyone <\/em>has done that.\"<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, everyone has cringed when they have unexpectedly bumped into their ex at a bar. Which is why \"Hurricane\" was such a breakthrough for Luke: he captured that universal awkwardness perfectly, not in a ballad, but in a roof-raising sing- along that has become a cornerstone of his concerts.<\/p>\n<p>But even Luke will tell you that his best songs are the ones that bust common phrases wide open. In \"Don't Tempt Me,\" he dares you to show him a good time; \"Be Careful What You Wish For\" laments the things he no longer has; and in \"I Got Away With You,\" he delivers a manly love song about making off with his lady's heart.<\/p>\n<p>It's the Nineties country homage \"When It Rains It Pours,\" however, that best shows off Luke's way with words, as he celebrates a deluge of good fortune after a breakup. It's an exceptionally thought-out song, with lyrics that eschew the abstract for the concrete. A winning scratch-off ticket, a waitress's number on the back of a check and a used four-wheeler all figure into the narrative.<\/p>\n<p>\"It reminds me of a Brad Paisley song, when he does those really cheeky, clever songs like 'I'm Gonna Miss Her,'\" says Luke. \"I'm influenced a lot by the smart lyrics of Paisley and especially Eric Church. I love writing about old sayings and colloquialisms and flipping them upside-down.\"<\/p>\n<p>Luke does likewise with \"This One's for You,\" the album's title track and its high- water mark. While its title may hint at a beer-drinking anthem, it's actually a love note to the ones who've supported him along the way. \"<em>There are a couple people that I owe a beer to \/ and three or four I owe more than a few<\/em>,\" he sings in the opening line<\/p>\n<p>\"My friends, the guys in my band and my parents helped me through so much and were always very encouraging. That's where this song was born from and why it's very special to me,\" he says. \"I named the album that because it sums up my whole life.\"<\/p>\n<p>In the end, <em>This One's for You<\/em>, produced by Scott Moffatt, showcases a singer and writer unafraid to tell his story without pretension or from behind a false front. In a genre that throws around words like \"genuine\" and \"real\" with abandon, few artists so earn those adjectives like Luke. He is the walking, writing and singing embodiment of three chords and the truth.<\/p>\n<p>\"There's no smoke and mirrors with me. There was never any point where I picked up the guitar and said, 'I want to be a country singer.' I just wrote songs and they were country songs,\" he says. \"Now I get to live my life writing and playing for people around the country. What a cool thing, right?\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LukeCombs_2_13_44_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"July 6 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LukeCombs\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lukecombs\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/718COspgdWOnwOFpJHRZHS"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lukecombs"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.lukecombs.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/LukeCombsVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/event\/07005454DE157340?CAMEFROM=CFC_SUMMERFEST_LINEUP&BLAKESHELTON"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:42 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-weeknd":{"id":"3963","name":"The Weeknd","friendly_url":"the-weeknd","stages":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p>Starting off his career anonymously, The Weeknd first broke into the music scene with the 2011 mixtape House of Balloons.

The Atlanta-based band, led by singer\/lyricist Andy Hull with Robert McDowell (who is also Hull&rsquo;s brother-in-law and lifelong friend), had spent their career challenging each other to build a poignant, exhilarating narrative with each new album and EP. The band had worked relentlessly to cultivate a passionate fan base the old-fashioned way: releasing music,&nbsp;making music videos, and touring (most recently with drummer Tim Very and bassist Andy Prince). Their previous long-player, 2014&rsquo;s Cope, had even spawned a cover album of itself by its creators, an acousticreworking and reimagining of its songs with a heavily emotional bent that they called Hope. But now &mdash; thirty years old, stable, and a frst-time father &mdash; Hull found himself facing a crisis of inspiration. Since the beginning, each subsequent Manchester Orchestra album had been a grand statement for that specifc moment in their career, originated in a desire to push themselves forward creatively. The desire to achieve greatness is often followed by a need for that same desire to evolve. So, for a musician used to writing out of self-refection, what do you sing about when life is good? For a band on record number fve and seeking innovation, how do you untangle yourself from the past? How do you write songs about being happy?<\/p>\n<p>It was becoming clear that they required a completely new approach from an entirely different sphere and set of faculties &mdash; and, lo and behold, just such a moment arrived when Hull and McDowell were offered the chance to score a movie.<\/p>\n<p>In the midst of the Cope\/Hope LP release cycle, the directing duo The Daniels &mdash; who had created a dense, theatrical music video for Manchester Orchestra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Simple Math&rdquo; in 2011, winning Vimeo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Music Video of the Year&rdquo; in the process &mdash; countered Hull and McDowell&rsquo;s request for them to work on another video with the idea of scoring the directors&rsquo; in-the-works feature flm debut, Swiss Army Man. They had never written a flm score before, but the pair of musicians happily rose to the challenge. The Daniels&rsquo; immediate guideline was: &ldquo;Cool, don&rsquo;t use any instruments.&rdquo; In the project, Hull and McDowell recognized an opportunity to leave their comfort zone and to push emotion to new heights.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Cope was very much a record where we knew what we wanted and it was a goal in our heads we could chase; that was followed by the polar opposite in Hope. But once we started work on the soundtrack, we threw the textbook out and started approaching music against our instincts,&rdquo; says McDowell. &ldquo;I think the score kind of was like going back and getting a doctorate. Once we fnished it, there was this whole new realm of situations and sounds that we could go down.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Swiss Army Man was a weird &mdash; albeit cult &mdash; Sundance hit, and the flm&rsquo;s New York Times-lauded &ldquo;marvelously melancholic music&rdquo; earned rave reviews around the world. Riding that excitement, Hull and McDowell decamped to a cabin near Asheville, North Carolina, with bandmates Very and Prince to write a new record. Inspired by their experience creating the score, they seized the chance to rethink Manchester Orchestra&rsquo;s typical methods of working.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a band that loves to use heavy, crunchy guitars,&rdquo; says Hull. &ldquo;We wondered how we could limit the use of that, so that when the guitars come in they can be creative and impactful. For Swiss Army Man we had to make seventy minutes of music with our hands tied behind our backs. When you&rsquo;re creating all the sounds you need just from the human voice, it allows you to rethink what is possible, and determine what is really needed. We wanted to make an album in a &lsquo;non-Manchester&rsquo; way if there is such a thing. So we started looking for people to help us do that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This process gave them new ideas of how to think about writing, how songs could fow, and how to layer melodies on top of one another to propel the tune into a new emotional arena. To manifest this vision, the band turned to producer Catherine Marks (Foals, PJ Harvey, The Killers, Interpol) and began working with her at Echo Mountain studio in Asheville. &ldquo;She just got it immediately. Catherine looked at us and said, &lsquo;I hear Twin Peaks: The Album here,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Hull. The band instantly connected to her unique sonic outlook for the record: Marks wanted each song to sound like a different room. \"Like you could understand where you were in the room and identify where each particular sound was coming from, pick it out with your hands and pull it out,&rdquo; Marks explains, adding, &ldquo;Being able to utilize the sound of the rooms we recorded it in, whether it was at Echo Mountain, or literally standing in a bath and engaging with the reverberation and refections that those rooms provided -- as opposed to manufactured reverbs -- was super exciting to me.&rdquo; In addition to mixing with Marks at her Assault &amp; Battery studio in London, Manchester Orchestra also worked with John Congleton (St. Vincent, Explosions In The Sky, Angel Olsen, Cloud Nothings) in Los Angeles &mdash; gathering new sounds, adding to and widening the songs&rsquo; dimensions &mdash; as well as their longtime producer Dan Hannon, who offered an invaluable perspective that only an old friend could give. Encouraged to go against frst instinct, each collaborator added their own touch to the music, pushing it to places no Manchester Orchestra record had ever gone before. As Marks says, &ldquo;Throughout the entire process, the band fought for the unknown and the unquantifable.&rdquo; In thoughtfully deconstructing and rebuilding their songwriting process, the band pushed themselves to create their best album yet.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was a test&mdash;personally, emotionally, creatively&mdash;to see how far we could push ourselves without breaking,&rdquo; says McDowell. &ldquo;This record was intentionally un-compromised on every level. We made sure to explore all the options and that we were moving forward with the strongest approach for each song&mdash; strongest part, strongest melody, strongest lyric.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Describing a rock record as &ldquo;cinematic&rdquo; usually implies a double-length, sprawling album with a full orchestra on every song; A Black Mile to the Surface is cinematic in that it conjures worlds. There&rsquo;s magical surrealism at work, with songs about a boy with no ears (&ldquo;The Alien&rdquo;) and the father\/sleeping child callback of &ldquo;The Sunshine.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a story to parse here &mdash; three brothers, an abandoned wife and child, a mysterious journey through the depths of a miles-deep mine, a narrative of twists and turns, recurring characters, alternating timelines &mdash; but the songs and melodies stand on their own.<\/p>\n<p>The initial creative spark for Hull&rsquo;s lyrics came from a photograph. &ldquo;While we were writing the album in Asheville it was snowing heavily at the cabin. I was reminded of what it feels like to live in a place that is cyclically cold. No matter what happens you can&rsquo;t escape it,\" says Hull. &ldquo;I had written a song with a character in South Dakota, so I started looking up pictures of &lsquo;winter in South Dakota,&rsquo; and there it was.&rdquo; What he found was a picture of a road with snow piled high forming walls on either side, maze-like; cars were frozen in time, the sky a white-nothing blur. Hull began to write songs from the perspectives of different characters who might live in the scene, and found that as he was creating these fctional stories, it became much easier for him to talk about the things that were happening in his own life. In &ldquo;The Gold,&rdquo; a song about a woman missing her husband as he descends into the blackness of the mines, Hull saw his own wife left alone with their young child after yet another months-long tour. As he sang these characters&rsquo; concerns, he realized he was really singing his own.<\/p>\n<p>A Black Mile to the Surface is a bold record of vision and purpose, inspired by and dwelling in a sensory and imaginative experience. It&rsquo;s a reinvention of sorts, both musically and personally&mdash;a sort of cosmic worldview shift. But in the end, the record&rsquo;s themes are universal. On the stunning fnal track, Hull sings, &ldquo;Let me watch you as close as a memory\/ Let me hold you above all the misery\/ Let me open my eyes and be glad that I got here.&rdquo; Certainly, that&rsquo;s a father speaking hope to his daughter, but it&rsquo;s also a message to listeners. How do you write songs about being happy? With your eyes wide open, your loved ones in front of you, and the misery of the world waiting just outside the door.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_ManchesterOrchestra_2_46_36_PM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"American Family Insurance Amphitheater","date_time":"July 8 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"american-family-insurance-amphitheater","date":"July 8","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ManchesterOrchestra"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/manchesterorchestra\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5wFXmYsg3KFJ8BDsQudJ4f"},{"type":"twitter","link":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/manchesterorch"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/themanchesterorchestra.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/manchesterorchestra"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/www1.ticketmaster.com\/event\/0700545AEE438004?CAMEFROM=CFC_SUMMERFEST_LINEUP&ARCADEFIRE"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"marshmello":{"id":"3723","name":"Marshmello","friendly_url":"marshmello","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>One white helmet. Two blacked-out eyes. And a loveable smile. Say hello to the new face of electronic music: Marshmello.<\/p>\n<p>As one of the latest acts to take the electronic world by universal storm, Marshmello met the most meteoric rise right from the get-go. The enigmatic producer continues in a long line of music makers putting sound and artistry ahead of image and ego. The mystery artist dons a fully enclosed marshmallow helmet, completely hiding the musician in seemingly plain sight. Rather than use the masked approach as a marketing gimmick, Marshmello instead employs it to echo his driving ethos: Let the music speak for itself.<\/p>\n<p>And so it does&mdash;very loudly and very clearly.<\/p>\n<p>Marshmello experienced almost immediate renown upon launching the project in March 2015 solely on the success of a handful of originals and remixes just a year ago, with tracks like &ldquo;SuMmeR,&rdquo; &ldquo;FiNd Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;BLocKs,&rdquo; and more paving the way. Following this string of mysterious music came a media blitz from all the reputable electronic and global music outlets&mdash;with international digital retailer Beatport crowning him a Breakthrough Artist in 2015&mdash;as well as an army of soon-to-be fanatics, lovingly dubbed his Mellogang, with both camps literally trying to unmask Marshmello.<\/p>\n<p>His crafted brand of feel-good melodies and trapped-out dirty bliss is both uplifting and unabashedly intense. It&rsquo;s enough to fill a stadium with unison sing-alongs while demolishing worldwide dancefloors within the same beat. Game recognizes game, and soon after debuting, dance music heavyweights Skrillex and Diplo sought Marshmello for an official remix of their Jack &Uuml; mega hit, &ldquo;Where Are &Uuml; Now&rdquo; with Justin Bieber. Elsewhere, Marshmello has done official remixes of fellow superstars Avicii, Zedd, Ariana Grande.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, Marshmello stands at the top of his game with his debut album, Joytime. Unleashed in January 2016 as a surprise release, Joytime&mdash;a compilation of his previously available tracks&mdash;placed in the Top 100 overall iTunes chart and topped the iTunes Electronic Albums chart at #1 upon its first day of release. Additionally, Joytime landed in the Top 5 on Billboard&rsquo;s Top Dance\/Electronic Albums chart and also made moves across the Heatseekers Albums and Independent Albums charts. The album also gained considerable momentum across various Billboard charts on the strength of power single &ldquo;Keep It Mello&rdquo; featuring rapper Omar LinX, which placed on the Hot Dance\/Electronic Songs, Dance\/Electronic Digital Songs, and the Spotify Viral 50 charts. A critical and commercial success, Joytime proves Marshmello&rsquo;s prowess as a songwriter and producer with crossover potential.<\/p>\n<p>On the live front, Marshmello dominates the stage via his highly anticipated and hyper-frenetic DJ sets. Armed with the iconic white marshmallow helmet, the masked producer releases an unmatched level of amped-up energy that's carried across a sonic vehicle of blood-pumping bass and hip-hop and trap ruggedness, all the while embracing pop-laden grooves and melodies at the core. His performances have gained him notoriety across the live music and festival circuit, garnering him high-profile performances at Ultra Music Festival, HARD Day of the Dead, Beyond Wonderland, and more, with an upcoming debut at mega festival Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas in June 2016. He&rsquo;s also headlined his solo Keep It International Tour, a 29-date trek in which all shows were sold out in advance, along with an Australian tour featuring multiple festival performances.<\/p>\n<p>As the layers of mystery continue to surround Marshmello, so too does the hype. Whether the world uncovers the man behind the mask is never the focus. Rather, the music within is what unites Marshmello to his beloved, growing Mellogang and the greater music world as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I just want to make good music,&rdquo; proclaims Marshmello. &ldquo;That doesn't require you knowing who I am.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Marshmello_8_11_37_AM_4_3_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/marshmellomusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marshmellomusic"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/64KEffDW9EtZ1y2vBYgq8T"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/marshmellomusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/marshmellomusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCEdvpU2pFRCVqU6yIPyTpMQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 12:20:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lil-uzi-vert":{"id":"3881","name":"Lil Uzi Vert","friendly_url":"lil-uzi-vert","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>Hip-hop could certainly use a real bona fide rockstar.

He doesn't simply stand out in a crowd; he draws everyone right to him.<\/p>\n<p>\"I try to create a world,\" the 20-year-old declares. \"It's rap, but I get a lot of influence from rock music. When you see me or hear me, I want the experience to be dark and crazy with a lot of moshing.\"<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in the city Schoolly D, The Roots, Meek Mill, and Rocky Balboa call home, Lil Uzi Vert first picked up a microphone in high school. He spent countless hours honing his craft, making sporadic trips to New York City in order to record through his friend William Aston's studio connection. Along the way, he carved out a distinct style that reflects his love for Wiz Khalifa as much as it does his passion for Marilyn Manson.<\/p>\n<p>\"I take influences from everything and put them into what I do,\" he says. \"It's a really delicate balance, and it's something I'm proud of. You can wear skinny jeans and still be hard.\"<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, he began to set the internet on fire. There was his explosive appearance on Carnage's single \"WDYW\" alongside A$AP Ferg and Rich The Kid and later his turn on \"Big Racks\" for Young Thug's Slime Season 2. In addition, he spent the summer with DJ Drama, priming the crowd for Wiz Khalifa and Fall Out Boy on their \"Boys of Zummer\" Tour. However, everything set the stage for his newest mixtape, 'Luv Is Rage.' With support from The Fader, Noisey, XXL, Vibe, HotNewHipHop, and more, Lil Uzi Vert naturally took the spotlight when it dropped.<\/p>\n<p>\"'Luv Is Rage' is just the beginning,\" he declares. \"It's the first statement.\"<\/p>\n<p>The project's opener \"Safe House,\" produced by Maaly Raw, fuses woobly and woozy dripping sonics with irresistible paranoid raps and a hypnotic chant.<\/p>\n<p>\"You might think it's safe in your hood, but it's not,\" Lil Uzi Vert warns. \"It's crazy. You can't be comfortable in the streets, so I'm letting everybody know, 'Stay with your money. Stay on your grind. Take care of yourself.'\"<\/p>\n<p>On \"Queso,\" he joins forces with Wiz Khalifa for a bombastic and bright banger, while he and Young Thug deliver a moving tribute to A$AP Yams on the ethereal \"Yamborghini Dream,\" produced by TM88.<\/p>\n<p>\"Yams was the first person I met from A$AP,\" he admits. \"He reached out to me, and we talked a lot for a whole year. I never met him in person though, but he meant a lot to me and Thug. That's why we needed to shout him out.\"<\/p>\n<p>Now, signed to Generation Now -- founded by DJ Drama, Don Cannon and Leighton Morrison -- alongside Atlantic Records, Lil Uzi Vert stands poised to ignite hip-hop with his own fire. \"I take modern rap and put more musical influence to it under the trap,\" he leaves off. \"I want to show people the future and what's possible with the sound.

Tyler is considered one of music's most recognizable and dynamic frontmen and has been cited by Rolling Stone as \"one of the greatest singers of all time.\" Hits like &ldquo;Janie&rsquo;s Got a Gun,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dream On,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Wanna Miss a Thing&rdquo; amongst others have solidified the band&rsquo;s place in history. Aerosmith&rsquo;s collaboration with rappers Run DMC on 1987&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walk This Way&rdquo; was both a commercial and critical success and it is still noted as one of the first derivative iconic mergence of rock and hip-hop genres. Tyler and Aerosmith have sold more than 150 million records worldwide, he has won four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, and an Emmy Award. In addition to having nine number one hits, 25 gold, 18 platinum and 12 multi-platinum album certifications, Tyler, along with the rest of his band members were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2013, Tyler was awarded with the Founder's Award at the ASCAP Pop Awards and was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame. Tyler and Aerosmith recently finished their North America \"Let Rock Rule\" tour with Slash. Currently, Tyler is working on his upcoming highly anticipated solo project.<br \/><br \/>The ultimate \"brand man,\" Tyler has built a name for himself outside of his career in music. Since 2007, Tyler has been hard at work with inventor and engineer Mark Dirico developing and designing a hip brand of motorcycles called Dirico Motorcycles. In December 2010, he performed for President Obama and the First Lady in a special tribute to Sir Paul McCartney at the Kennedy Center Honors. Just a month later, Tyler joined Jennifer Lopez, Randy Jackson, and host Ryan Seacrest as a judge on &ldquo;American Idol,&rdquo; the highest rated television show in American history. In May 2011, Tyler released his memoir entitled Does the Noise in My Head Bother You? (Ecco\/Harper Collins) which debuted at #2 on the New York Times Bestseller List. Simultaneous with the book's release, Tyler debuted his first ever solo single, \"(It) Feels So Good\" (featuring Nicole Scherzinger), which broke into the Billboard Hot 100, the highest charting song by an Aerosmith member since 2001's \"Jaded.\"<br \/><br \/>After vocal surgery in 2006, Tyler now sits on the Advisory Board of the Voice Health Institute alongside Julie Andrews, Joe Buck, Roger Daltrey, Christina Perri, Lionel Richie, Paul Stanley and Keith Urban. An active philanthropist, Tyler has also been involved with supporting numerous charitable organizations including: the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Adopt the Arts, MusiCares, Robin Hood, Race to Erase MS, Red Cross and many others. Additionally, Tyler has been advocating in opposition to a compulsory license for remixes, mash-ups and derivatives which would take away the artists' rights to remain in control on how their songs are used. He was recently honored with the American Songwriter Award from the National Music Publisher&rsquo;s Association in Washington D.C. for his career and advocacy work.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>Infamous for his outrageous style and fashion savoir faire, Tyler was the inspiration and design consultant for the Andrew Charles rocker chic fashion line from Tommy Hilfiger's Star brands, which featured an entire line of rock n' roll clothing in 2012. Furthering his presence in the fashion world, Tyler teamed up with Modo Eyewear for his own-featured line of reading and sunglasses. Tyler has also ventured into the animation world, with the release of Epic in 2013, from Twentieth Century Fox Animation (Ice Age, Rio), where he lent his voice to the character Nim Galuu. The voice cast of Epic also includes Beyonc&eacute;, Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson, Amanda Seyfried and Johnny Knoxville.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>When not on the road touring Tyler splits his time between Los Angeles, Boston and Hawaii, where he is an avid diver.<\/span><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_StevenTyler_3_22_10_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 3 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 3","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/steventyler"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/IamStevenT\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/32zks9ovi0IExzUd1C7W6o"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IamStevenT"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/officialsteventyler.tumblr.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:16 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"kesha":{"id":"3798","name":"Kesha","friendly_url":"kesha","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Kesha&rsquo;s latest album 'Rainbow', called \"an artistic feat\" by Entertainment Weekly and \"the best music of her career\" by Rolling Stone, marks a new beginning for Kesha.

And while it's understandable that, in this moment, some people want their radio to help them drift away, this finely calibrated set of ten songs is aimed right between the clear eyes of people who prefer to stay present and awake. It's a call to those who won't cower no matter how erratically the world turns, and who aren't afraid of what looks back when they look in the mirror. Bruce Springsteen did that. Neil Young did that. Jason Isbell does that.<\/p>\n<p>There are songs on this album that cut to the chase. \"Last year was a son of a bitch for nearly everyone we know,\" Isbell sings on the album's first single, \"Hope the High Road.\" \"But I ain't fighting with you down in the ditch. I'll meet you up here on the road.\" As singular as that lyric is, there's nothing coy or obtuse about it. Meanwhile, other songs here take a subtler tack.<\/p>\n<p>Check out track three, \"Tupelo.\" It plays like a warm ode to Northeast Mississippi-on the first few listens, it sure sounds like a loving tribute-but on the fourth you realize that the town the protagonist is extolling is actually a blazing hellhole. Perfect-as a hideout, anyway. \"You get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering,\" Isbell sings. \"There ain't no one from here who will follow me there.\" It's the kind of twist that compels the fifth listen-and the fiftieth.<\/p>\n<p>As with Isbell's 2013 breakthrough, Southeastern, and his double-Grammy-winning follow up, 2015's Something More Than Free, The Nashville Sound was produced by Dave Cobb. Isbell says that he and Cobb created a simple litmus test for the decisions they made in the two weeks they spent at RCA Studios (which was known as \"The home of the Nashville Sound\" back in the '60's and '70s): they only made sonic moves that their heroes from back in the day could've made, but simply never did. It's a shrewd approach-an honest way to keep the wiz-bang of modern recording technology at arms length, while also leaving the old bag of retro rock 'n' roll tricks un-rummaged. Lyrically, The Nashville Sound is timely. Musically, it is timeless.<\/p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that this album isn't credited to Isbell alone. For the first time since 2011's Here We Rest, Isbell's band, the 400 Unit, gets title billing. \"Even when I was writing, I could always hear the band's stamp on the finished product,\" Jason says. \"These songs needed more collaboration on the arrangements to make them work, and I felt like the band deserved it after the way they played.\" Given Cobb's strict insistence on cutting songs live with no demos or rehearsals, you can easily imagine how the brilliantly raw performances on the record will translate to the stage when the band takes these new songs out on the road.<\/p>\n<p>And boy, there's nothing like a 400 Unit show. Not just because the band smokes, but also because Isbell's fans are among music's most ardent. They listen to these songs for months and months on their own, and that momentum rolls them right up to the doors at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, or the Beacon Theatre in New York or the Fabulous Fox Theatre in Atlanta. And when the band kicks in, they are ecstatic. It's a rock 'n' roll show that feels like fellowship.<\/p>\n<p>Which begs a question: Why do Jason's songs strike us so deeply? What makes this music of the soul? The answer has to do with Jason's authenticity, his intellect, his rootedness in both tradition (see: the childhood in Green Hill, Alabama, near Muscle Shoals, where he grew up picking and singing in the style he remembers here on \"Something To Love\") as well as modernity (see: Jason singing about anxiety, or his complicated relationship to his iPhone).<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, Jason has a gift for taking big, messy human experiences and compressing them into badass little combustible packages made of rhythm, melody and madly efficient language. The songs are full of little hooks-it could be guitar line that catches one listener, or a quick lyric that strikes to the heart of another-and an act of transference takes place. The stories Jason tells become our own. The music is coming not from Jason and the band, but from within us.<\/p>\n<p>As you listen to this record, you will hear many themes: humor, heartache, wisdom, beauty, hope. But chief among them, strangely, is leadership.<\/p>\n<p>If Southeastern (2013) was the Getting Sober record (Jason has been searingly honest in both songs and interviews about the time he spent in rehab), and Something More Than Free (2015) was the New Clarity record, maybe this one, The Nashville Sound, is the Way Forward.<\/p>\n<p>And who better to lead us forward than Jason Isbell? Jason is a relentless and fearless selfinterrogator. (The first line of \"Cumberland Gap\"-\"There's an answer here if I look hard enough\"-will be familiar to those who know him.) And this album is a challenge, a gauntlet in song: Let's claim ownership of our biases (\"White Man's World\"). Let's embrace and celebrate the uncomfortable idea that the force that activates both life and love is death (the instantclassic \"If We Were Vampires\"). Let's consciously choose light over darkness (\"Hope the High Road\"). And for God's sake, if you are feeling anxious, alone, disenfranchised, depressed, mad as hell, or scared as shit, find something that gasses you up and work at it (\"Something to Love\"). Jason, it seems, after years grinding the rail that separates terra firma from the brink, has put in the sweat equity it takes to hug it out with his demons and fill his life with meaning, bright and clean.<\/p>\n<p>If that sounds good to you, this album lights the path.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JasonIsbellandThe400Unit_5_05_53_PM_3_15_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 5 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 5","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jasonisbellmusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jasonisbell\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3Lg3FGwBxOGuefqekQzRUf"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JasonIsbell\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jasonisbell.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/JasonIsbellVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/02\/2018 02:02:31 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"alesso":{"id":"3845","name":"Alesso","friendly_url":"alesso","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>With over 5 million followers online and YouTube views in the millions, Grammy nominated<br \/>producer Alesso already has a huge following thanks to his hugely popular sound and sold-out shows around the globe. His breakout track \"Heroes (we could be)\" featuring Tove Lo soared to over 310 million streams and Top 10 Airplay in the UK and US, amassing over 1.5 billion streams worldwide to date. His recent album FOREVER debuted as the #1 electronic album in the country on iTunes and he's currently headlining some of the biggest festivals around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Beginning his career five years ago as a self-taught 18 year-old bedroom producer in Stockholm, Sweden, Alessandro Lindblad&rsquo;s trajectory to the forefront of the global dancefloor is truly incredible. He began by tinkering with other people&rsquo;s songs, creating his own edits, adding piano riffs and melody ideas, and uploading his versions to Beatport. Alesso&rsquo;s efforts reached Swedish House Mafia&rsquo;s Sebastian Ingrosso, who swiftly took the teen under his wing, becoming his mentor, and signing him to his management and label. Alesso made an impressive entrance with the &lsquo;Taking It Back&rsquo; remix of Avicii&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alcoholic&rsquo;, but it was his addition of a classic house drop to Nadia Ali&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pressure&rsquo; that helped the single become one of the most played dance tracks of 2011. Swiftly unleashing a barrage of brilliant remixes for Swedish House Mafia, Devolution and LFMAO, the then teenager was named EDM Artist To Watch by MTV.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, he teamed up with Ingrosso and OneRepublic&rsquo;s Ryan Tedder for &lsquo;Calling (Lose My<br \/>Mind)&rsquo;, which went to No.1 on the Billboard Dance chart and has since been streamed over 63+ million times on Spotify. That same year, he was invited to open for Madonna on her MDMA tour, before releasing a volley of commercially and critically celebrated remixes including David Guetta &lsquo;Titanium&rsquo;, Keane&rsquo;s &lsquo;Silenced By The Night&rsquo; and OneRepublic&rsquo;s &lsquo;If I Lose Myself&rsquo;. Since then, he has played to sold-out crowds all over the world and landed a prestige Las Vegas residency at XS Nightclub with The Wynn. He headlined the Saraha tent at Coachella 2 years in a row, receiving the title &lsquo;Most Instagramed&rsquo; artist for 2015 by Mashable. Being the trendsetter he is Alesso was the FIRST EVER musician to premier his music video for &lsquo;Tear The Roof Up&rsquo; on snapchat receiving over 500,000 views in less than 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>This music producer has been able to make a flawless transition into the world of fashion by being the face of Carolina Herrera&rsquo;s &lsquo;212 VIP&rsquo; fragrance in 2015. This collaboration has opened the door for much more. Becoming one of the first electronic artists to create and premier a track for the gaming community on TWITCH &lsquo;Payday&rsquo; debuted with Starbreeze and has plans for future collaborations. Next Alesso had a partnership with AXE which launched in February of 2016 in the Nordic Regions. He will also be a huge presence in Asia at the end of 2016. Being the world&rsquo;s largest electronic artist on LINE; Alesso has future collaborations with Jolin and EXO.<\/p>\n<p>Alesso has returned with a beautiful new love song titled \"I Wanna Know\" featuring platinum selling duo Nico &amp; Vinz. It premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 Thursday, March 31st and now solidifies Alesso as an undeniably skilled songwriter with over 32 million streams on Spotify and climbing. With a beautify shot video by top director Colin Tilley, it signifies a new chapter for him, shaped by his time in Los Angeles and his maneuvering through the joy and confusion of love. In the July 2016 Alesso donated the track to Stockholm Pride as they created one of the first ever #prideparades with the world famous video game Grand Theft Auto V.<\/p>\n<p>Alesso closed 2016 with new single Take My Breath Away debut&rsquo;d at his sold out show at the iconic Greek Theater, Los Angeles. The track signaled again a production in which he co-worte the topline on, adding a more sensual club sound, unafraid to stay away from the formula followed by so many. Following this with his stripped back single, Falling, (co-written by himself) again we hear the more sensual side of Alesso harkening back to his club roots. With a remix of The Chainsmokers &amp; Coldplay's 'Something Just LIke This' as well as a slew of boundary-pushing singles soon to come, 2017 looks to be another unstoppable year for Alesso.<\/p>\n<p>Taught to play the piano as a young child, Alesso grew up on pop idols including Michael<br \/>Jackson, before discovering Hip Hop via Nelly, Pharrell and Timbaland. But it was hearing his first House track as a young teenager that really opened Alesso&rsquo;s eyes to the possibilities and power of music. &ldquo;We would go to underage parties when I was 13, 14 years-old,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;It was the cheesier end of Dance music, but I immediately gained a new perspective of what music is. I had never felt that kind of feeling - I still get it today - that rush and excitement. I want to be alive, explore the world, show love and spread love. House music makes me feel like nothing is impossible. I can conquer the world.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He quickly immersed himself in as much House as he could find; a friend made him a mix CD and it was here that he discovered Daft Punk, Erick Morillo, Steve Angello, Daft Punk and Axwell. Throwing himself fully into making music at the age of 18, part of Alesso&rsquo;s success is down to his diverse influences and huge appetite for life which riddle his infectious creations with an energy that is palpable. Alesso&rsquo;s debut album proves the Swede won&rsquo;t be limited by genre or niche. There&rsquo;s soul, melody and adventure in his compositions; there&rsquo;s never merely one tempo or type of terrain. &ldquo;Every song I make is House at its core, but because I&rsquo;ve listened to so much Hip Hop, I think you hear an element of ruggedness in my music. I like to mix it up a little bit - not keep the same beat all the time. I&rsquo;m not in any way making Hip Hop music, but I&rsquo;m very influenced and interested in bringing different grooves into my songs.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever want to make just another club song,&rdquo; Alesso insists. &ldquo;&lsquo;Electronic music&rsquo; sometimes feels like it&rsquo;s all about the money; I can say one hundred per cent that I didn&rsquo;t start doing this to make money. The main reason why I make music is to bring a message; I want to uplift people though music, I want to inject emotion into dance music. I want people to scream, jump, feel happiness. Explosive happiness. The best thing about music is it has no rules; I love the idea of breaking the rules.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Alesso_11_07_47_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlessoOfficial\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/alesso\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4AVFqumd2ogHFlRbKIjp1t"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Alesso"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.alessoworld.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCPew18bTw43HRb5Rt5m-liw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:15 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-flaming-lips":{"id":"3835","name":"The Flaming Lips","friendly_url":"the-flaming-lips","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 6","description":"<p>The Flaming Lips are an American rock band, formed in Norman, Oklahoma in 1983.<br \/> <br \/> Melodically, their sound contains lush, multi-layered, psychedelic rock arrangements, but lyrically their compositions show elements of space rock, including unusual song and album titles&mdash;such as \"Psychiatric Explorations of the Fetus with Needles\", \"Free Radicals (A Hallucination of the Christmas Skeleton Pleading with a Suicide Bomber)\" and \"Yeah, I Know It's a Drag... But Wastin' Pigs Is Still Radical\". They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\".<br \/> <br \/> The group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with \"She Don't Use Jelly\". Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the \"Best International Act\" category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.<br \/> <br \/> On October 13, 2009 the group released their latest studio album, titled Embryonic. On December 22, 2009, the Flaming Lips released a remake of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side Of The Moon. In 2011, the band announced plans to release new songs in every month of the year, with the entire process filmed.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_FlamingLipsThe_1_29_14_PM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/flaminglips"},{"type":"instagram","link":""},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/16eRpMNXSQ15wuJoeqguaB"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theflaminglips\/"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.flaminglips.com\/tour\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/flaminglips"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:21 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"pixies":{"id":"3795","name":"Pixies","friendly_url":"pixies","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Joey Santiago is in love.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;The longest I separated from this girlfriend is probably a week. Then I listened to her again. Haha! I love it!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The object of Joey&rsquo;s desire is his band&rsquo;s new album, <em>Head Carrier<\/em>. The Pixies&rsquo; guitarist may have finished recording it months ago, but he remains utterly smitten. He takes it to bed and discovers little details he hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. &ldquo;I was shocked at some songs, they shine at lot better than I thought they would. You could listen to this forever and enjoy it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, he wants to show his new baby to the world.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I played it to some friends and both of them had goose-bumps &ndash; they just loved it! It&rsquo;s tough and lush. Warm and dark and murky&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Santiago&rsquo;s giddiness might come as a surprise. This isn&rsquo;t his first time, after all. <em>Head Carrier<\/em> is the seventh Pixies album, in a lifespan stretching back 30 years to their formation in Boston, Massachusetts. But there is, the guitarist notes, a new element to the Pixies&rsquo; DNA this time.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Paz. She&rsquo;s awesome. Now, everything is just so light, we&rsquo;ve got lightness. I think I lost 12 pounds it&rsquo;s so light now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Paz is Paz Lenchantin, the bass player who joined the Pixies at the start of 2014, before the release of <em>Head Carrier<\/em>&rsquo;s predecessor, <em>Indie Cindy<\/em>, but after its completion. If there was any lingering uncertainty regarding her official status, even during the two years of touring that followed, that&rsquo;s changed now. Her position was sealed, emotionally, when she sang one of the new album&rsquo;s stellar moments, &ldquo;All I Think About Now,&rdquo; a song she co-wrote with Pixies&rsquo; lead singer-songwriter Charles Thompson aka Black Francis and which is a tribute to Kim Deal, the original Pixie whose role Paz now occupies.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It just came at the last minute, a week before the recording process ended,&rdquo; says Lenchantin. &ldquo;I came up with some chords which I showed Charles, and he really liked it and he put some lyrics to it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Paz said she wanted me to write a letter &ndash; a thank-you letter,&rdquo; says Black Francis. &ldquo;So I did. It was kinda poignant for us. It was important that song was a collaboration. Something from the Pixies&rsquo; DNA but also something from her as the new member, together.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The genesis of <em>Head Carrier<\/em> began even as <em>Indie Cindy<\/em> was being made &ndash; a direct consequence of Kim Deal&rsquo;s decision to quit the band in June 2013 during a recording session at Rockfield Studios in Wales. &ldquo;So we knew we had to make another one, even before we finished <em>Indie Cindy<\/em>,&rdquo; says Black Francis. &ldquo;That one by definition had turned into this transitional moment. We tried to make that transitional moment as good as we could, but no matter how great we potentially could make it, we knew it would still beg the question: what&rsquo;s your new paradigm? It still remained transitional. Instead of becoming defining, it became transitional.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Although almost 23 years separated <em>Indie Cindy<\/em> from its predecessor, 1991&rsquo;s <em>Trompe Le Monde<\/em>, the Pixies&rsquo; 2014 comeback album that felt like a solid and contiguous addition to the canon. Both records were produced by genial Liverpudlian taskmaster Gil Norton, who had also guided the band on <em>Doolittle<\/em> (1989) and then <em>Bossanova<\/em> (1990). But when Black Francis and Joey Santiago sat down to discuss what might come next, they instinctively knew a change was required.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Joey and I decided that we had to be a little more self-defined, by the band, as opposed to the band&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; says Francis. &ldquo;Pro-active as opposed to remaining where we had been. Not that we wouldn&rsquo;t work with Gil Norton again, but we felt like we had to work with someone else. Seemed like the right thing to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We said the next one has to be a punch in the face,&rdquo; adds Santiago. &ldquo;Gil could have easily done it, but we had to get out of our comfort zone. We had to find a tough audience per se, and that meant a different producer.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>At their manager&rsquo;s suggestion, in September 2015 the Pixies met Tom Dalgety in Toronto, where the band was recording demos. The English producer of Royal Blood&rsquo;s breakthrough debut, Dalgety&rsquo;s other credits include such noted volume dealers as Killing Joke and Opeth. But according to Black Francis, the specifics of his track record mattered less than whether he was agreeable company for a meal.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We hired Tom over dinner. We liked him. We liked his personality. And we knew that he had produced records before. So it&rsquo;s not like &ndash; &lsquo;Does this guy know what he&rsquo;s doing?&rsquo; &lsquo;I dunno, whatever&hellip;&rsquo; He&rsquo;s produced some records! Yeah, he knows what he&rsquo;s doing! Everyone understands what the task is at hand. But &ndash; do you like the <em>person<\/em>? Can you sit down and have dinner with them? Ah, I like this person. I think we can make a record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Near the end of 2015, the band undertook three weeks&rsquo; pre-production at Real World Studios, near Dalgety&rsquo;s hometown of Bath. The producer pulled some songs apart and outright rejected some others, including one the band had been hitherto convinced was a keeper. &ldquo;Your ego has to go out the door if someone says, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Santiago, &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s their job. He&rsquo;s won Producer Of The Year, for crying out loud &ndash; who are we to say?! But when I came up with something good Tom would tap me on the back and give the thumbs-up. And I&rsquo;d feel awesome.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Tom took the lead on what songs worked better with each other,&rdquo; adds Lenchantin. &ldquo;And then we just played them &rsquo;til they sounded right. Played them every day, for hours!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to their staunch work ethic and Dalgety&rsquo;s precision eye for arrangements, the band arrived at London&rsquo;s RAK Studios in February in a heightened state of readiness. According to drummer David Lovering, they had never been so well drilled prior to making an album.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That was just a joy for me, &rsquo;cos I would consider myself a slow learner,&rdquo; he chuckles. &ldquo;Previous albums like <em>Trompe Le Monde<\/em> and <em>Bossanova<\/em>, the later ones, those came together very quickly and it almost wasn&rsquo;t until two months into a tour where I would go, Aha, this is how the songs should go! So I always have trepidation going into the studio. I listened to <em>Indie Cindy<\/em> not long ago, and I was like &ndash; Owwww! It hurt me a little, some things I heard. But when I listen to this album, I&rsquo;m very, very happy.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Recorded in just three weeks, <em>Head Carrier<\/em> has the sonic hallmarks of a classic Pixies album &ndash; tungsten guitar riffage, sun-soaked harmonies, rhythmic pummel and lyrical intrigue &ndash; while never pandering to nostalgia. Aligned to its palpably fresh momentum, many of its songs have a poignant undertow, acknowledging its creators&rsquo; real time\/real life journey. At least three, according to Black Francis, &ldquo;fall into the sour grapes love song category&rdquo;, though two of these &ndash; &ldquo;Classic Masher&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bel Esprit&rdquo; &ndash; feel quite exultant. The title track and &ldquo;Plaster Of Paris,&rdquo; meanwhile, share a somewhat thematic kinship, though the linkage is worthy of a cryptic crossword setter, turning upon the grisly fate of Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Head Carrier&rsquo; is the story of Saint Denis, as told from the perspective of one of his collaborators, Luther,&rdquo; says Francis. &ldquo;Saint Denis is also the most famous cephalophore. Then, I was reading a lot about how plaster of Paris was first commercially manufactured from the same place that Saint Denis met his demise, which was Montmartre. That was a nice way to tie in a lot of that imagery.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the songs offer a typically varied buffet of Pixies esoterica: rural roadside prostitution in France and Belgium (&ldquo;Um Chagga Lagga&rdquo;), the Mesopotamian deity Baal (&ldquo;Baal&rsquo;s Back&rdquo;) and the legendary American actor Jack Palance, who makes a cameo appearance in the rambunctious &ldquo;Talent,&rdquo; one of two songs whose primary musical influence Black Francis attributes to The Stranglers.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Trying to channel their energy &ndash; and not necessarily pulling it off, but it&rsquo;s always nice to shoot for lofty things. I wanted to use Jack Palace primarily because his name was a nice soft rhyme with &lsquo;talent&rsquo;. But I do like Jack Palance &ndash; I would never have used just anybody just because their name rang a certain way. The combination of your name ringing a certain way and the fact that you&rsquo;re an iconic cool actor&hellip; basically, you&rsquo;re a shoo-in for the job.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s emotional core, meanwhile, resides in its second half, amid the plangent &ldquo;Tenement Song&rdquo; (&ldquo;A song about music, a song about songs,&rdquo; says Francis, &ldquo;and where music comes from &ndash; maybe people in your family who showed you how to play the piano&rdquo;), or the closing &ldquo;All The Saints,&rdquo; which boils down all questioning to its eternal essence: &ldquo;Wondering why I&rsquo;m still here\/Too many times I had fear\/Trying to be near you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And of course, the beatific &ldquo;All I Think About Now&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Remember when we were happy?\/If I&rsquo;m late can I thank you now?&rdquo; &ndash; a tribute to the Pixies&rsquo; past from its freshly alchemised now.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;How could anyone make any of this up?&rdquo; wonders Paz. &ldquo;I could never imagine it. This is a great band. I&rsquo;m just happy to be a part of it. I respect and honour their beautiful past and I&rsquo;m so fortunate to be part of the band&rsquo;s present and future. It&rsquo;s unfortunate what happened with the departure of Kim, but with a tip of the hat to her I also respect the path that she&rsquo;s given me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That the Pixies could have a viable present in the 21st century, let alone a bright future, seemed impossible during the 10 years following their break-up in 1993, and again following Deal&rsquo;s departure. But there&rsquo;s always been a whiff of alchemy to this band that confounds the natural order of things. It&rsquo;s a large reason why they remain so special, and so beloved.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a dysfunctional band,&rdquo; acknowledges Lovering. &ldquo;But when you get older, it&rsquo;s not that you get wiser, it&rsquo;s just that you learn how to put up with everyone&rsquo;s shit a little better! That&rsquo;s what it is. So we&rsquo;re putting up with everybody&rsquo;s shit. And because of that, and because Paz lessens the craziness, it&rsquo;s a pleasure.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We never take it for granted,&rdquo; adds Santiago. &ldquo;But at the same time, it&rsquo;s so natural for us. There&rsquo;s that chemistry where we get together, and we just have to go, &lsquo;Oh OK &ndash; we sound like the Pixies. Fuck &ndash; we are the Pixies!&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PixiesThe_1_11_50_PM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 4 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 4","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pixiesofficial\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pixiesofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6zvul52xwTWzilBZl6BUbT"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pixies"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.pixiesmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":""},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:17 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"greta-van-fleet":{"id":"3821","name":"Greta Van Fleet","friendly_url":"greta-van-fleet","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>Frankenmuth, Michigan &ndash; Michigan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Bavaria&rdquo; - is known for its scenic farmland. Crispy chicken dinners. The State&rsquo;s best indoor water parks. Picturesque wine and chocolate boat cruises. The world&rsquo;s largest Christmas store.<\/p>\n<p>These days it&rsquo;s also home to one of the most exciting rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll acts to come from the heartland, or anywhere, in many a year.<\/p>\n<p>Greta Van Fleet &ndash; which took its name from one of the close-knit community&rsquo;s town elders &ndash; is a hard rocking quartet whose creative ambitions and achievements reach far beyond the ages of the four band members, not all of them old enough to have voted in last November&rsquo;s election. On its debut EP <em>Black Smoke Rising<\/em>, the group&nbsp;deftly straddles the line between timeless and future, sounding at once like many things you&rsquo;ve heard before and also something you&rsquo;ve never heard before.&nbsp; The three brothers &ndash; twins Josh (vocals) and Jake (guitar) Kiszka, younger brother Sam Kiszka (bass, keyboards) and drummer Danny Wagner &ndash; have turned their rich and varied musical background into an arresting m&eacute;lange of rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll with flavors of metal, pop, blues and grunge, the result of years of practice, study and familial good times.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When we were not even born yet my father played us blues music and R&amp;B, soul music &ndash; all the good stuff,&rdquo; says Sam.&nbsp; Dad Kiszka was a musician himself, playing guitar and harmonica. &ldquo;Our parents had a lot of&nbsp;vinyl laying around,&rdquo; recalls Josh, so we grew up listening to that and really liked playing with the vinyl albums &ndash; putting them on the turntable and speeding them up and slowing them down. But, yeah, I really liked the blues and the soul and the funk &ndash; Wilson Pickett is the big one, and Joe Cocker, those kinds of things.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The Kiszka kids furthered their music education during winter ski trips to Michigan&rsquo;s Yankee Springs, where a plethora of family and friends would gather with instruments. Someone was playing something nearly every minute of the day, and Josh, Jake and Sam soaked it up with relish. &ldquo;Every year was better than Christmas,&rdquo; Josh recalls. &ldquo;In the evenings or during the day, there was always music being made there, everybody getting together and experimenting with sounds, having lots of fun, making music.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Jake, meanwhile, it was &ldquo;really awe-inspiring when you see this completely surrealistic environment, to see all these people from all over the place come together, and what brought them together was music. That was mind-blowing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It was Jake who turned that inspiration into Greta Van Fleet, drawing the idea from the likes of Cream, the Yardbirds, The Who and other 60s British Invasion favorites. &ldquo;We liked to see how the English bands had reinterpreted the blues, and we wanted to interpret it again &ndash; Y&rsquo;know, wouldn&rsquo;t it be interesting if an American band came right back and reinterpreted the reinterpretation that the English did?&rdquo; the guitarist explains.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought there was something there that needed to be created.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Jake gradually assembled his brothers into a band. Sam was caught up when Jake began jamming at the family home with a drummer friend from school. &ldquo;It dawned on me that I needed to play bass for them,&rdquo; Sam says. &ldquo;Plus,&rdquo; he joked, &ldquo;my mom always said I looked like a bass player.&rdquo; Josh, meanwhile, was studying theater, film and painting at school, with acting giving him an ease on stage, as well as a voice, that made him a no-brainer to be Greta Van Fleet&rsquo;s frontman. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t something I set out to particularly do. But it felt pretty natural,&rdquo; he says now.<\/p>\n<p>Danny Wagner, a friend of Sam&rsquo;s since kindergarten, became the last piece of the Greta Van Fleet puzzle, joining a year after the group started, after being&nbsp;a regular at the Kiszka house for jams and rehearsals. &ldquo;We all have similar taste in music and that helps a lot,&rdquo; Wagner notes. &ldquo;But at the same time we have these little differences in what we like, and when it comes together it produces this sound. It&rsquo;s got that classic kind of vibe but it has a lot of soul, a lot of energy, and that&rsquo;s a huge part of it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>You won&rsquo;t find a better description of the four songs on Greta Van Fleet&rsquo;s EP, recorded at Rust Belt Studios in suburban Detroit with producers Al Sutton (Kid Rock, Hank Williams Jr.) and Marlon Young from Kid Rock&rsquo;s Twisted Brown Trucker Band. The introduction runs a gamut from the dusty grind of &ldquo;Highway Tune&rdquo; to the sinewy punch of &ldquo;Safari Song&rdquo; and the muscular crunch of &ldquo;Black Smoke Rising.&rdquo; &ldquo;Flower Power,&rdquo; meanwhile, is a trippy sonic tapestry that weaves psychedelic and folk textures into the mix. &nbsp;&ldquo;No limits, no barriers, no boundaries,&rdquo; Jake declares. &ldquo;It was like that when we were growing up, and it&rsquo;s like that when we&rsquo;re making our own music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Listen closely and you&rsquo;ll also hear the flavor of a small, tight-knit community seeping into the group&rsquo;s songs. &ldquo;I think it has a huge presence in the music,&rdquo; Josh says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this romantic, simple, Americana kind of thing, like Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn growing up outside of town in the country.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The good news is there&rsquo;s more where these four songs came from. The group has been in the studio for about two years now, with nearly 20 tracks down and more coming every day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been writing since Josh and I were 16 and Sam and Danny were 13,&rdquo; Jake says. &ldquo;We have so many songs we&rsquo;re working on it&rsquo;s ridiculous. We&rsquo;re just trying to develop and get better. That&rsquo;s very important to us.&rdquo; So is playing live, where Greta Van Fleet has been slaying audiences with an electrifying show that sounds more like a band that&rsquo;s been around for decades rather than just a few years. The group can&rsquo;t wait to take it around the country, and around the world in support of the EP, showing off the big sound this band from a little town can make whenever it hits the stage.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really happened so quickly. It&rsquo;s definitely overwhelming and exciting &ndash; and it&rsquo;s awesome,&rdquo; says Wagner. &ldquo;All these things are happening &ndash; the record deal, management, William Morris (booking agency). It&rsquo;s slowly starting to build up, and we&rsquo;re starting to get that fever. We&rsquo;re itching to show everybody who we are and what we can do.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GretaVanFleet_12_30_42_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 1 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 1","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gretavanfleet\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gretavanfleet\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4NpFxQe2UvRCAjto3JqlSl"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GretaVanFleet"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.gretavanfleet.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCJwpwfxya4dPJJnq5lUUBbQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:31 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"foster-the-people":{"id":"3799","name":"Foster the People","friendly_url":"foster-the-people","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p>Foster The People&rsquo;s third album <em>Sacred Hearts Club<\/em> is a 12-track effort that joyously flexes the group&rsquo;s infinite creative powers, fusing neo-psychedelia, punk, funk, electronic, dance and hip hop. Bolstered by a diverse slew of groove-oriented songs, including the infectiously funked-out title track SHC, the synth-fused glide of &ldquo;Doing It For The Money,&rdquo; and the psychedelic prowl of &ldquo;Loyal Like Sid &amp; Nancy,&rdquo; (complete with spoken-word piece that recalls Gene Wilder's memorable lines in&nbsp;<em>Willy Wonka&nbsp;and the Chocolate Factory<\/em>), the band captured a patient, &lsquo;spiritually improvised&rsquo; vibe in the studio that set the tone for the entire album.<\/p>\n<p>Foster and longtime touring cohort Isom Innis (he and Sean Cimino became full-fledged members this year alongside original member Mark Pontius, with Cubbie Fink departing the band in 2015) combined their formidable artistic strengths and &ldquo;chased the music.&rdquo; The first seeds were planted when they come off the road promoting their previous album, <em>Supermodel<\/em>. &rdquo;We&rsquo;d go into the studio in L.A. or wherever we were and just start writing,&rdquo; says Mark. &ldquo;Verse chorus vibe was kind of our rule until we started transitioning to something transformational. We had that saying &ndash; &lsquo;no stone left unturned&rsquo;. So we took our ideas in many different ways through a process of construction and deconstruction.\"<\/p>\n<p>The result is Foster&rsquo;s indelible hooks intricately tethered to fertile, more adventurous beats, the two artists channeling shape-shifting chord progressions over cascading hip hop veins, blast beats, unstoppable dance grooves and snatches of hardcore punk. &ldquo;We wanted to start out with a blank canvas not knowing where the songs would take us,&rdquo; says Isom. Foster elaborates: &ldquo;We wondered whether we wanted these different sounds we were creating to interact with one another... or to separate it, and as we continued to write, the sounds started to come closer again, intersect in a way that felt like we wanted to put it on one record. The records that excite me the most are the ones that take me on a ride.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Enlisting producers Josh Abraham and Oliver Goldstein, Lars Stalfors, Patrik Berger, and John Hill contributed to what Foster calls the &ldquo;creative kindred spirit&rdquo; of the album. He also points to the polarized global climate as being a catalyst towards a more thoughtful approach. \"For the past two years I felt like I&rsquo;ve woken up and something has happened that is tragic,\" he says. \"A bombing, a terrorist thing, refugee crisis, the political situation with Trump, with the DNC leaks, Brexit, and seeing nationalism rise around the world, racism, homophobia...All these things I thought we were evolving past as humans seem to have come back in full force. For us it became clear that as artists we wanted to make something that was joyful and unifying.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_FosterthePeople_12_26_38_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fosterthepeople"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/fosterthepeople\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7gP3bB2nilZXLfPHJhMdvc"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fosterthepeople"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.fosterthepeople.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/FosterThePeople"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:19 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"billy-currington":{"id":"3816","name":"Billy Currington","friendly_url":"billy-currington","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>Billy Currington&rsquo;s latest album bears the breezy title <em>Summer Forever<\/em>, but the talented Georgia native has spent more than a decade in the spotlight proving he&rsquo;s truly a man for all seasons. Possessing one of the smoothest and most distinct voices in any genre of music, Currington is equally skilled at delivering upbeat summertime anthems as well as exploring the complexities of life and love with a poignant ballad. On <em>Summer Forever<\/em>, Currington&rsquo;s sixth studio album, he brings both with a collection of songs that will take the listener on a riveting musical journey and leave them breathless at the end of the ride.<\/p>\n<p>Since his self-titled debut album bowed on Mercury Records in 2003, Currington has scored eleven career No. 1 singles, most recently, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Hurt Like It Used To.&rdquo; His other hits that reached the No. 1 spot include such memorable songs as &ldquo;Good Directions,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let Me Down Easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Must Be Doin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo; Right,&rdquo; &ldquo;People Are Crazy,&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s How Country Boys Roll,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hey Girl,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Are Tonight.&rdquo; Over the years, the self-effacing Georgia boy has amassed an impressive list of accolades. He won the &ldquo;Hottest Video of the Year&rdquo; honor at the fan-voted CMT Music Awards for &ldquo;Must Be Doin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo; Right&rdquo; in 2006. The same year, he received an ACM nod for Top New Male Vocalist. His hit duet with Shania Twain, &ldquo;Party for Two,&rdquo; earned nominations from both the CMA and ACM. &ldquo;People Are Crazy&rdquo; took Currington&rsquo;s already hot career to another level. He earned Grammy nominations for Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song in addition to being nominate for Single and Song of the Year from the Country Music Association.<\/p>\n<p>Currington has come a long way from his rural Georgia roots. He spent his early years on Tybee Island before his family moved inland to Rincon. He grew up listening to vinyl records by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings and Kenny Rogers, and when his mom took him to one of Rogers&rsquo; concerts, 10-year-old Billy knew immediately he wanted to someday be the one on stage performing. However, he wasn&rsquo;t sure how he was going to get there. &ldquo;To be honest, I never even heard of Nashville till I was 17 or 18,&rdquo; he says. All that changed when Currington&rsquo;s pastor recognized his talent while he was singing in church, and decided to give the youngster some career guidance. &ldquo;He had been living in Nashville at one point,&rdquo; Currington recalls. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Man, there&rsquo;s a town called Nashville that you can get a record deal. Your dreams could come true. I&rsquo;m going to take you there.&rsquo; So he took me and showed me the town. He introduced me to people. When I got back home, I totally made up my mind that when I graduated high school I was going to go back.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And so he did. He made the move to Music City at 18 and began paying his dues by pouring concrete and working as a personal trainer at a gym during the day. At night, he was getting a musical education playing in bars all over Nashville. Naturally, he began meeting other aspiring songwriters and artists. He began writing songs and his warm, strong voice made him one of the town&rsquo;s most in demand demo singers. &ldquo;I was doing 10 demos a day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Before you know it, I started getting deal offers from record labels.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He signed with Mercury in 2003, and immediately garnered attention with his debut single, &ldquo;Walk a Little Straighter,&rdquo; an autobiographical song about life with his alcoholic stepfather. The song peaked at No. 8, an auspicious debut for a newcomer. He proved the quick success was no fluke when he followed with &ldquo;I Got A Feelin,&rdquo; which became his first top five hit. From there, the hits continued as his sophomore album <em>Doin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo; Right<\/em> spawned his first No. 1 with &ldquo;Must Be Doin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo; Right&rdquo; and his second No. 1 with &ldquo;Good Directions.&rdquo; Released in 2008, his third album, <em>Little Bit of Everything<\/em>, featured five songs co-written by Currington. The Bobby Braddock\/Troy Jones penned &ldquo;People Are Crazy&rdquo; became his third No. 1 and he followed that with a song he co-wrote, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s How Country Boys Roll,&rdquo; which also hit the top of the charts. In September 2010, Currington released <em>Enjoy Yourself<\/em>, which included No. 1 hits &ldquo;Pretty Good at Drinkin&rsquo; Beer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Let Me Down Easy.&rdquo; His fifth album, <em>We Are Tonight<\/em>, further fueled him momentum spawning two No. 1 singles &ndash; &ldquo;Hey Girl&rdquo; and the title track.<\/p>\n<p>Though Currington has grown in knowledge and confidence, his goals in making Summer Forever is the same as when he recorded his debut. &ldquo;Music is a snapshot of people&rsquo;s lives and most of all, I want to leave people in a happy place,&rdquo; he says with a smile. &ldquo;Whether they&rsquo;re sitting on a beach listening to this album or they&rsquo;re walking around their house or cleaning their house or whatever. Wherever they&rsquo;re at listening to this album, I want to leave them with a happy and peaceful feeling.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BillyCurrington_2_24_31_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"June 29 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"June 29","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BillyCurrington?fref=ts"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bccoconutman\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1By9QBFnjZAoI83BZppHlt"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/billycurrington"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.billycurrington.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BillyCurringtonVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:29 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"janelle-monae":{"id":"3956","name":"Janelle Monae","friendly_url":"janelle-monae","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-06","long_dates":"July 6","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, July 6","description":"<p>At long last, Janelle Monae -- the inimitable, award-winning, songwriter, performer, producer, CoverGirl and avant-garde funkstress -- is back again, ready to release her another full-length \"emotion picture\" to the masses. But as always, Janelle is not ready to talk about music just yet. She'd rather talk about her past and how those fertile powerful experiences forced her to create her coming album \"The Electric Lady.\"<\/p>\n<p>According to Monae, \"I went back to Kansas City after my tour for my debut album 'The ArchAndroid.' And when I looked around me, I decided I wanted to make a raw, revealing album all about my life and the things I'd experienced in my community -- about the laughter in the parks, the jams bumping in the cars, the jokes told over kitchen tables, all the life and warmth and struggles I felt there. But I also wanted to figure out how to take Kansas City to the future...like a surreal Parliament album with lyrics by Octavia Butler and album art by Salvador Dali.\"<\/p>\n<p>As time passed, Monae found herself increasingly drawn to the stories and experiences of the strong women in her life, and their ability to electrify and inspire individuals to do the right thing. \"At some point I realized that the true heart and glue of the community were the women. My mama and grandmamma and my aunties and who to this day, are some of the most powerful beings on the planet. Under their guidance, I went from cleaning houses everyday in my maid outfit to the world-traveling performer I am today. They made me believe in myself enough to move from Kansas and pursue my dreams. A lot of folks think I work hard onstage because of James Brown. But they've never met my mother!\"<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by her mother and other matriarchs, Monae began to write lyrics and songs about rebel women who refused to be marginalized and dared to live their life boldly and unapologetically in a distant future. According to Monae, \"When I returned to the studio, I felt I had to do my part. Through my art, I had to help create the woman I wanted to see around me. Incidentally, during concerts, for years I'd been painting this woman's physique -- the silhouette of her hips -<\/p>\n<p>I have hundreds of these paintings with the same feminine figure over and over...this glowing Technicolor woman...seen from behind...regal, powerful and electric...My colleagues and friends told me to name this mysterious figure because she seemed to be a totem, a powerful symbol for me. So I named her 'The Electric Lady,' and that's where the album's title came from.\"<\/p>\n<p>As she began the audacious task of following up on her acclaimed debut LP \"The ArchAndroid\" -- an album that topped critic's lists in 2010 all over the world -- she took along some trusty, brave companions: the original music producers of \"The ArchAndroid,\" Nate \"Rocket\" Wonder and Chuck Lightning of Wondaland Productions. And together they crafted a new strain of jamming music they called \"ish.\" In the hip hop community, \"ish\" is a euphemism for the profane four-letter word for excrement, but as Monae explains, they set out, like proverbial alchemists, to turn lesser substances into gold. \"This entire project was produced by Wonder &amp; Lightning. We set out to make a soundtrack for the Obama era, something that spoke to the beautiful, majestic and revolutionary times that we're living in. The musical language we're speaking now is called ish. In the African-American community, we've been turning left-overs (like chitlins) and social depredation (like poverty) into delicacies and fine art for years. So we just set out to turn the rubbish all around us into something beautiful. Ish is the bowtie on the funk.\"<\/p>\n<p>From the sound of \"The Electric Lady,\" ish is an urgent and dangerous form of dance music, rebel music that forces one to fight, jam, and fall in love. Like on \"The ArchAndroid,\" the sonic textures of the album are varied, and the past and present come together to explode and create a mind-blowing future for pop and soul music. For example, wondrous strings reminiscent of Curtis Mayfield and Bernard Herrmann orchestrations abound, Hendrixian guitar solos soar, Outkast-like raps float over punk rock riffs; defiant socially-conscious lyrics extol the virtues of soul-searching and fighting for change, while the funk simply melts your speakers: 808s boom and Prince-like synthesizers squiggle in your earhole, making it veritably impossible to just sit still.<\/p>\n<p>\"As we like to say at Wondaland, the booty don't lie. The booty always obeys the LAW OF THE JAM. You can't hate on something that makes your booty move, that makes you jam and have a good time. And the booty will always tell you the truth of a given situation. You can always tell what a community or a person truly believes by just studying the actions of their booties at any given time. They can claim they love this other person or culture, or believe in this peaceful god, or really want freedom, but do their actions prove it? Their actions, what their booties do or don't do, that tells you the truth.\"<\/p>\n<p>The recording process was fun, rewarding, but also strained by Monae's newfound need to be more courageous and personally revealing in her storytelling. \"To do this album properly, I had to revisit some turbulent chapters in my life, deal with some questions and experiences left over from my childhood. There were so many things I had questions about. Sexual things. Racial Things. Gender things. Memories. Things I thought I had left behind me. New things I was discovering. But ultimately I found myself emulating my mother and grandmother and using their strength to surpass my fear. I had to do that before I could write and sing and perform these new songs convincingly. I'm not the kind of artist that can perform something night after night, if I don't believe in it, or if it's not true to me or my experience.\"<\/p>\n<p>Monae was also inspired and emboldened by her truly amazing collaborators: Roman GianArthur, the wunderkind and Wondaland Arts Society artist-in-residence that, once again, provided the album's magisterial overture; the soul star Miguel, who crooned his way effortlessly to the stars and helped provide a prime baby-making moment on the lush ballad \"Primetime\"; Erykah Badu, her self-ascribed \"twin,\" who used her cosmic grace and poise to help turn the first single \"Q.U.E.E.N.\" into a female empowerment anthem and a runaway smash; and none other than her lifetime hero, the legendary Prince, who contributed in countless ways, musically, vocally, and most importantly, spiritually -- by conversing with her from his purple telephone in Minneapolis, whenever she was weak and unsure which artistic direction to go.<\/p>\n<p>As she worked, Monae found herself, as always, drawn again into her other love, science fiction, and the exploits of Cindi Mayweather, the heroine of her first EP \"Metropolis.\" In fact, the new album serves as Suite IV and V of her Metropolis saga, and in this chapter, the android hero Cindi moves from self-realization to self-actualization: from the knowledge and owning of her unique superpowers, to actually using them to better the world around her. Monae says, \"I like to think you can hear me using my superpowers this time. And not just talking or wondering about them. \"The Electric Lady\" is like the big action sequence in the third act of an epic film. Every party this album starts, or every baby born because of it, is actually another victory against the Great Divide.\"<\/p>\n<p>As she continued to work on the album, Monae found herself displaying these superpowers in new ways in the recording studio, and found that some of her best creative work was done when she was running entire production sessions by herself. \"There were key moments like the rap on Q.U.E.E.N. where I needed to be alone. I dimmed the lights, setup the mic and engineered myself. I just let the words and sounds flow through me. Overall, I've been feeling stronger as a producer, as well as writer.\" In addition, on this album, Monae had the chance not only to produce herself, but also to produce her collaborators Miguel, Erykah Badu and Prince. \"I'm still humbled by the collaborations and partnerships I have on this album. I actually got the chance to produce and write for some of my heroes. And through my recording label the Wondaland Arts Society, I've been executive producing the artists I love. Wondaland artists such as Deep Cotton and Roman GianArthur. I'm proud of the Wondaland movement, and this new phase in my life as an artist, producer, and businesswoman.\"<\/p>\n<p>The fruits and rewards of this artistic journey can be heard in ample measure on the album's courageous, outrageously funky first single \"Q.U.E.E.N,\" which features the queen herself, Erkyah Badu. \"Erykah's one of my best friends, and we talk about everything. That particular song really developed from a deep conversation we were having about a woman's place in the world. And how we were expected to be freaks and muses and virgin goddesses all at the same time by patriarchal cultures and religions. Rather than answer all the questions we just decided to jam to them and let the booties decide.\"<\/p>\n<p>Now that the album is complete, Monae finally has a concrete formula for the Electric Lady that she summed up by turning her first single \"Q.U.E.E.N.\" into an acronym. In Monae's own words, \"An Electric Lady is Quirky, Unafraid, Electric, Epic and Nicety. That's when you're being nice and nasty, noble and naughty all at the same damn time. Because even superheroes need a glass of red wine. Even rebel women need a kiss every once in a while. What's proper and acceptable behavior simply depends on the time of day...and the kind of week you've been having.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JanelleMonae_10_41_29_AM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 6 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 6","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/janellemonae"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/janellemonae\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6ueGR6SWhUJfvEhqkvMsVs"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JaNelleMonae"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jmonae.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/janellemonae"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/03\/2018 02:56:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jethro-tull":{"id":"3792","name":"Jethro Tull","friendly_url":"jethro-tull","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>Ian Anderson, known throughout the world of rock music as the flute and voice behind the legendary Jethro Tull, celebrates his 50th year as an international recording and performing musician in 2018.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ian was born in 1947 in Dunfermline, Fife, Scotland. After attending primary school in Edinburgh, his family relocated to Blackpool in the north of England in 1959. Following a traditional grammar school education, he moved on to art college to study fine art before deciding on an attempt at a musical career. Tull formed in 1968 out of the amalgamation of the John Evan Band and McGregor&rsquo;s Engine, two blues-based local UK groups.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After a lengthy career, Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull have released 30 studio and live albums, selling more than 60 million copies since the band first performed at London&rsquo;s famous Marquee Club in February 1968.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After undertaking more than 3000 concerts in 40 countries during five decades, he has typically played 100-plus concerts each year to longstanding, as well as new fans worldwide. Widely recognized as the man who introduced the flute to rock music, Ian Anderson remains the crowned exponent of the popular and rock genres of flute playing. So far, no real pretender to the throne has stepped forward. Ian also plays ethnic flutes and whistles together with acoustic guitar and the mandolin family of instruments, providing the acoustic textures which has been an integral part of most of the Tull repertoire.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson has so far recorded seven diverse albums under his own name during a long career: 1983's <em>Walk Into Light<\/em>, the flute instrumental <em>Divinities <\/em>album for EMI&rsquo;s Classical Music Division in 1995 which reached number one in the relevant <em>Billboard <\/em>chart, and the more acoustic collections of songs, <em>The Secret Language of Birds<\/em>, <em>Rupi&rsquo;s Dance<\/em>, plus rock albums <em>Thick As A Brick 2<\/em>, 2014&rsquo;s <em>Homo Erraticus, <\/em>and <em>&ldquo;The String Quartets,&rdquo;<\/em> his 2017 collaboration with England&rsquo;s The Carducci String Quartet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, he has toured more and more as simply Ian Anderson, often with orchestras, string quartets, featured soloists.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Anderson lives on a farm in the southwest of England where he has a recording and rehearsal studio and offices. He has been married for 40 years to Shona who is also an active director of their music and other companies. They have two children &ndash; James and Gael &ndash; and two grandchildren. Gael is married to actor Andrew Lincoln, currently shooting more episodes of the hugely-acclaimed zombie thriller, <em>The Walking Dead<\/em>, now preparing to shoot the 8th series as the most-watched TV drama ever.<\/p>\n<p>Ian's hobbies include the growing of many varieties of hot chili peppers, the study and conservation of the 26 species of small wildcats of the world and the appreciation of mechanical watches, fountain pens, and vintage cameras. He reluctantly admits to owning digital cameras and scanners for his work on the photographic promotional images related to <em>Tull <\/em>as well as his solo career.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2006, he was awarded a Doctorate in Literature from Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh, the Ivor Award for International Achievement in Music, and in the New Years Honours List 2008 an MBE for services to music. In 2011 he received another Doctorate in Literature from Dundee University.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ian owns no fast car, never having taken a driving test, and has a wardrobe of singularly uninspiring and drab leisurewear. He still keeps a couple of off-road competition motorcycles, a few sporting guns and a saxophone which he promises never to play again.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>He declares a lifelong commitment to music as a profession, being far too young to hang up his hat or his flute, although the tights and codpiece have long since been consigned to some forgotten bottom drawer.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JethroTull_12_40_59_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 27 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 27","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialjethrotull\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jethrotull_\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6w6z8m4WXX7Tub4Rb6Lu7R"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jethrotull"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/jethrotull.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/tullmanagement"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:15 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"tory-lanez":{"id":"3827","name":"Tory Lanez","friendly_url":"tory-lanez","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Following the release of his breakout single &ldquo;Say It&rdquo;&mdash;peaking at&nbsp;#1 on Rhythmic and Urban Radio as well as #23 on the Hot 100&mdash;rising singer, songwriter, rapper and producer&nbsp;Tory&nbsp;Lanez&nbsp;is on tour nationwide with A$AP Ferg in the midst of a nonstop touring schedule which has seen him lauded as an Artist To Watch by&nbsp;<em>Billboard.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Lanez&nbsp;capped off a banner 2015 with the release of two mixtapes,&nbsp;<em>Chixtape III<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The New Toronto<\/em>. 2015 also saw collaborations with Chris Brown, Meek Mill and more and the release of his critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Cruel Intentions<\/em>&nbsp;EP, a collaboration with tastemaking L.A. label WEDIDIT featuring production from RL Grime, Baauer and Shlohmo.

Melodies and lyrics swirl through his head. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll dissipate as seamlessly as they first arrived. Other times, the singer-songwriter can do nothing but begin singing them aloud. It frees his ever-churning mind. It allows him to continually discover his own voice. It grounds him. Most importantly, for a man prone to bouts of self-doubt, it reassures Moore that his path is a righteous one. &ldquo;I have a complete sense of calm right now,&rdquo; the singer-songwriter says. &ldquo;During this whole journey, as down as I&rsquo;ve gotten at times, I&rsquo;ve done this thing my way. I don&rsquo;t have any regrets. I&rsquo;m always looking ahead.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>The journey Moore speaks to is a monumental one: from that of a struggling Nashville musician to a massive country superstar with his mammoth 2012 debut album Up All Night; and an artistic adventurer with 2015&rsquo;s sonically bold and critically revered second effort, Wild Ones.<br \/><br \/>Now Moore is set to release his most unflinching, distinct testimony yet: &ldquo;I know how strong this record is. I know its capabilities,&rdquo; Moore says of SLOWHEART, the country star&rsquo;s evocative and profound third album due on September 8th. The culmination of an ever-evolving talent&rsquo;s process of selfdiscovery, the LP is a warm and honest embrace of Moore&rsquo;s rugged rock roots and a showcase for his innate poetic prowess.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;This album is growing into where I am now,&rdquo; Moore says of a vivid album that bleeds with lyrical raw emotion and rings true with sonic warmth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be one of those artists that&rsquo;s trying to stay relevant. I&rsquo;m going to grow as my music grows. I&rsquo;m going to grow as a human being.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>Central to Moore is the knowledge that in SLOWHEART he&rsquo;s created a collection of enduring, sturdy songs, ones that showcase his knack for rich storytelling and are not unlike the albums he was raised on. Over 13 tracks, Moore unfurls acute accounts of loss and longing (&ldquo;Plead the Fifth&rdquo;), confusion and conviction (&ldquo;Bittersweet Company&rdquo;), frivolous falsehood (&ldquo;Blonde&rdquo;) and always daring to dream (&ldquo;Guitar Man&rdquo;). &ldquo;I want to be an artist that moves people to their core and that they hold onto forever,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what got me into this; it was all for the purity of the music. I never gave two shits about money and fame,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It was all about the songs.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>Arriving at his current place of &ldquo;clarity and peace&rdquo; required Moore to remove himself from the rigors and oft-grinding politics of Nashville. Following the rigorous Wild Ones tour, the singer spent time traveling through Costa Rica, Hawaii and Iceland. He immersed himself in nature and self-reflection. &ldquo;It helped me to really step away from the whole industry side of things,&rdquo; Moore explains. He&rsquo;d been previously quietly writing and recording new material, four or five songs, if only to put his thoughts down on wax. &ldquo;It was a very organic process,&rdquo; Moore recalls of the earliest days of SLOWHEART. When Moore returned home from traveling he learned his record label was ecstatic with what he&rsquo;d created. &ldquo;They just went nuts over the songs. It was so nice,&rdquo; he says with a laugh. &ldquo;It was just like &lsquo;Hey man, go make the record you want. Nobody is gonna mess with you.&rsquo; So I had total freedom to do whatever I wanted,&rdquo; Moore, who produced the vast majority of SLOWHEART, adds, &ldquo;So I was going to go in and finish this record the way I heard it in my head and not have one sense of doubt. If I loved it and I felt it I recorded it.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>This take-no-prisoners attitude is all over the album, and slathered atop a swath of brutally honest cuts: &ldquo;The Bull,&rdquo; written by Jon Randall and Luke Dick and anchored by a spiraling acoustic guitar lick, is Moore&rsquo;s rejoinder to those who doubted him along the way. After Dick played him the song, &ldquo;I flipped out,&rdquo; Moore recalls. &ldquo;I was like, &ldquo;I definitely have to do this. This is exactly how I feel.&rdquo; On lead single &ldquo;More Girls Like You,&rdquo; Moore comes to terms with the prospect of settling down, maturing, and living a more reigned-in life. &ldquo;Well, I've been living like a wild old mustang\/Out in Montana fields,&rdquo; Moore sings with vigor and virtue. &ldquo;Might've earned me a bad reputation\/ But never stopped these wheels.&rdquo; The song, he says, was inspired after he helped a father teach his young daughter to surf while in Costa Rica. &ldquo;That is the first taste of the idea that I might be ready for my next chapter of life,&rdquo; Moore offers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very direct reflection of me evolving as a human being.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>The musician says he was intimately involved in the recording process for SLOWHEART like never before. &ldquo;Before I might get quiet in the studio but now I&rsquo;m not like that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Now I know what I want and what I hear in my head and that&rsquo;s what I want to be on the record.&rdquo; Alongside his engineer, Dave Salley, longtime co-writers like Westin Davis and David Garcia, and his band, the Slow Hearts, Moore crafted the album exactly as he saw fit: live and decidedly un-slick. The sonic feel then, Moore says, is of &ldquo;a band in a room just sitting down and figuring out a song and how it moves you. We kept all that warmth and air in the room. We didn&rsquo;t try to suck any of it out.&rdquo; To that end, Moore points to the six-minute reflective album closer, &ldquo;Guitar Man.&rdquo; Moore sang his entire vocal part live to tape as musicians Tom Bukovac and Dave Cohen unknowingly played the tender guitar lines in the adjoining room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you hear me taking breaths and catching up with my phrasing,&rdquo; Moore says with a laugh. &ldquo;I loved it.&rdquo;<br \/><br \/>The singer says he&rsquo;s immensely proud: not only of his career, his album and his never-compromising attitude, but of the trust and dedication he&rsquo;s fostered in his audience. That symbiotic relationship between Moore and his fans is never more apparent than during one of his reputation-making live performances. Moore views his shows as an emotional roller coaster with both he and his audience hanging on at every turn: the singer&rsquo;s calling card, a Kip Moore show typically swerves from the raucous and rowdy one minute to the intimate and emotional the next. It&rsquo;s led to a deep, profound and poignant bond between the singer and his fans. &ldquo;There was a huge undercurrent of fan support that&rsquo;s been building for the last couple years,&rdquo; Moore says of him beginning to sell out massive theaters across the country during the Wild Ones tour and, in the process, tripling the size of his audience, many of whom who chant every word he sings right back at him.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;Through this whole experience I&rsquo;ve had a sense of peace that I have a real fanbase that&rsquo;s gonna stick with me,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very in touch with my audience and they&rsquo;re in touch with me. I know how they&rsquo;re gonna feel about this project.<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m doing now has deep roots that are not going to break off,&rdquo; Moore continues. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been any gimmicks. I&rsquo;ll get to where I want to go.&rdquo; He pauses and lets out a knowing chuckle, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m going to do it the way I want.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_KipMoore_2_28_09_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/KipMooreOfficial"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.kipmoore.net\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KipMooreMusic"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/KipMooreVEVO"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/kipmooremusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2hJPr4lk7Q8SSvCVBl9fWM"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/02\/2018 02:29:18 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"kaleo":{"id":"3805","name":"Kaleo","friendly_url":"kaleo","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":"<p>Every story has two sides, and that adage is certainly true for Kaleo, the four-piece band from Iceland who now call the US home. Call it a split upbringing: the isolated heritage that results from coming of age in Iceland has paired with the fresh inspiration of moving to America, and the band has built a sound to match the disparate landscapes. A gorgeous and raucous blend of rock, folk and blues, Kaleo&rsquo;s debut LP embodies that very spirit of duality: titled A\/B, the album showcases the band&rsquo;s multi-layered dynamics and ability to play different genres with equal skill.<\/p>\n<p>Best friends since attending elementary school outside of Reykjavik, bandleader JJ Julius Son, drummer David Antonsson, and bassist Daniel Kristjansson began playing together at the age of 17 before adding guitarist Rubin Pollock to the mix in 2012. They named the band Kaleo, which means &ldquo;the sound&rdquo; in Hawaiian, and started their career in with a handful of well-received shows at the 2012 Iceland Airwaves music festival. The band signed to Elektra\/Atlantic and moved to the States in early 2015, choosing Austin as their new base.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It has obviously been a big change coming from a small country of 300 thousand people in Iceland to the USA with over 300 million people,&rdquo; says JJ Julius Son. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learned a lot, and we are more experienced now than when we first came. Overall it&rsquo;s been a great adventure.&rdquo; The past year has been a busy one for the band, as they&rsquo;ve played nearly nonstop&mdash;including over 45 US states&mdash;as well as notching a spot on the soundtrack to HBO&rsquo;s hit show Vinyl and recording a full length album with the producer Jacquire King in Nashville.<\/p>\n<p>The concept behind A\/B comes from Julius Son&rsquo;s love of the split sides of vinyl records and their ability to showcase an artist&rsquo;s different sides. &ldquo;I write very different songs that many would like to label into different genres,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The idea of A\/B is to show the diversity and the two sides of the band.&rdquo; The &ldquo;A&rdquo; side is more rock and roll and blues (opener &ldquo;No Good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Way Down We Go,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hot Blood&rdquo;), while the &ldquo;B&rdquo; side is a bit softer with more ballads (&ldquo;All the Pretty Girls,&rdquo; &ldquo;Vor I Vaglaskogi,&rdquo; and closer &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Go On Without You&rdquo;). But no matter which side you&rsquo;re on and which song is playing, the sound can only be that of Kaleo.<\/p>\n<p>A\/B was primarily produced and recorded with King, the esteemed production icon whose past work with talented artists as varied as Tom Waits, Kings of Leon, Norah Jones, Buddy Guy, James Bay, and Of Monsters and Men helped Kaleo showcase both their louder and softer sides. In addition to the sessions in Nashville, Kaleo wrote and recorded in various other locales around their new home in the US as well as a few different sessions around the world, from their home of Iceland to Spain and London as well. Additional production contributions to the album in these various sessions came from Mike Crossey, Arnar Gu&eth;j&oacute;nsson and the band.<\/p>\n<p>Starting off A\/B with a bang, &ldquo;No Good&rdquo; welcomes in the &ldquo;A&rdquo; side with its crunching, bluesy stomp-rock. Julius Son&rsquo;s deep, raspy growl is perfectly paired to the band&rsquo;s snarling assault, and sets the bar high for the rest of the record to come. &ldquo;Kiss your baby goodbye,&rdquo; he purrs, and with that, we&rsquo;re off and running.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Way Down We Go&rdquo; is filled with bluesy angst and anchored by piano and rhythmic, pounding drumming. Julius Son&rsquo;s vocals shift into the higher registers just as easily as they find their home at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;All the Pretty Girls&rdquo; leads off the &ldquo;B&rdquo; side, and in a sense it was the song that started it all for Kaleo in the beginning. In the spring of 2014, they recorded the lush, introspective song and in one night their destiny to outgrow their small, island nation was cemented, as it spread like wildfire across the airwaves.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Vor I Vaglaskogi&rdquo; is a traditional Icelandic love song, and the only one sung in the band&rsquo;s native language.

I never felt so free creatively.&rdquo; Co-writing every song, and working with stellar songwriters and producers including Ryan Tedder, Stargate, Jason Evigan, Ian Kirkpatrick, Nate Cyphert, Mitch Allan and Jon Levine, songs range from the shimmering unshackling of &ldquo;Broken Glass,&rdquo; to the sultry, infectious &ldquo;Shivers.&rdquo; More intimate songs such as the bewitching &ldquo;Collide,&rdquo; the piano-tinged &ldquo;Hands&rdquo; and the album&rsquo;s moving closer &ldquo;Grace&rdquo; reflect the unguarded side of the talented singer songwriter. &ldquo;I felt like there were no rules on what this album had to sound like,&rdquo; says Rachel.<\/p>\n<p>That sense of abandon is even more revealing when you consider the expectations around Platten have been raised considerably the last few years. Few artists in the past decade have struck a chord of hope and resilience like she did with her empowering triple platinum hit &ldquo;Fight Song.&rdquo; Listeners instantly adopted the transformative anthem as their own, linking fans&rsquo; tales of personal empowerment across the globe. The multi-platinum selling single topped countless radio and iTunes charts worldwide, with Rachel&rsquo;s Gold-certified, major label debut album &ldquo;Wildfire,&rdquo; released by Columbia Records in 2016, launching the platinum Billboard Hot 100 hit, &ldquo;Stand By You.&rdquo; And now, with 2017&rsquo;s Waves and its rallying cry &ldquo;Broken Glass,&rdquo; Rachel again delivers a searing, emotionally and socially relevant pop gem that has connected audiences and moved women to stand up for each other while also amplifying the power of individuality.<\/p>\n<p>Citing Waves as an honest effort at &ldquo;showing her range of emotions,&rdquo; the new album also reflects the winding journey of a female singer\/songwriter who has earned her place as one of pop&rsquo;s more spirited and authentic voices. Hailed by TIME as &lsquo;a torchbearer or woman&rsquo;s empowerment,&rsquo; she takes it all in stride. &ldquo;With everything that&rsquo;s happened to me I realized there is no top,&rdquo; says Rachel. &ldquo;You just circle it. I have so much more I want to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Rachel Platten was born in New York City and raised in Massachusetts, returning to New York after college to set out on her music career. She began playing in coffee shops around New York City, branching out to small venues around the country that taught her how to command a room and earn the respect of audiences wherever she performed. Her uplifting brand of wistful pop sustained her through those &lsquo;underdog&rsquo; years, with the tireless Rachel chipping away at the music business ceiling through dues-paying songwriting and live incarnations, gigging and touring at every opportunity. She says she turned &ldquo;inward&rdquo; to write &lsquo;Fight Song,&rsquo;&rdquo; the result of an intensive period of songwriting before re-emerging with the aspirational anthem and finding her &lsquo;voice&rsquo; with the fiery hit. The singer has also been lauded for her cathartic live shows.

Carter and Barthel first broke out in 2009 with the cinematic Eyelid Movies (Barsuk) &ndash; recorded in a barn in Saratoga Springs, NY (a stone&rsquo;s throw from their hometown of Greenwich) &ndash; and after a buzz-building EP (Nightlife, Barsuk) and much touring, Phantogram opted for a change of scenery by recording their expansive second LP, 2014&rsquo;s Voices (Republic), in Los Angeles with co-producer John Hill (M.I.A., Santigold).<\/p>\n<p>In between Voices (which spawned the hits &ldquo;Fall In Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black Out Days&rdquo;) and Three, Phantogram have certainly kept busy. They contributed to The Flaming Lips&rsquo; The Terror, A-Trak&rsquo;s &ldquo;Parallel Lines,&rdquo; and Miley Cyrus&rsquo; Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz, remixed Charli XCX, and were sampled by Kanye West and A$AP Rocky&hellip; not to mention their fruitful collaboration project Big Grams with OutKast&rsquo;s Big Boi. Following the release of a critically-acclaimed self-titled debut album in late 2015, Big Grams has proved to be a festival mainstay in 2016 &ndash; entertaining huge audiences with compelling sets riddled with Big Grams&rsquo; psychedelic hip-hop, and rounded out with the two acts&rsquo; mashups of each other&rsquo;s hit songs.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the full schedule, Carter and Barthel find themselves far from creatively tapped-out. Recent collaborations pushed them musically and Three displays a surging energy and appealing experimentation, effectively showcasing a band reaching for and achieving new aesthetic heights.<\/p>\n<p>The album was recorded over the past year at co-producer Ricky Reed&rsquo;s Echo Park-based studio. Finding inspiration in unlikely places for a band increasingly heard on commercial alternative and pop radio, Carter found fresh perspective in AfroBeat and &lsquo;60&rsquo;s R&amp;B when creating the steady beats that form the foundation of the album. Despite the new influences and a strong experimental motivation, Three still unmistakably sounds like Phantogram, with plenty of thick, buzzing beats and snaking melodic lines to sink your teeth into.<\/p>\n<p>Three is a triumphant record, but it also bears the mark of personal tragedy. During the recording process, the band suffered a devastating loss when Barthel&rsquo;s sister (and Carter&rsquo;s close friend since childhood) Becky passed away of suicide. Work on music stopped immediately, but then as the duo slowly returned to the studio the aftermath of their personal loss (compounded by the deaths of David Bowie and Prince, two of Phantogram&rsquo;s greatest musical heroes and inspirations) began to reverberate throughout the process, imbuing the album with varied shades of complicated, human emotion that Carter refers to as &ldquo;Finding the beauty within tragedy.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about heartbreak, and having to push forward and move on&mdash;and how challenging that is,&rdquo; Barthel states. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s made us the people we really are, and it&rsquo;s a huge part of what this record means to us.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Along with exploring new emotional territory, Three also finds Phantogram breaking new sonic ground. The album&rsquo;s eclectic, bold songs swerve from pop-inflected bangers (like lead single &ldquo;You Don&rsquo;t Get Me High Anymore&rdquo; and album-closer &ldquo;Calling All&rdquo;) to the skipping melancholia of &ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; which strikes a perfect balance between loping hip-hop rhythms, understated balladry, and gauzy indie-rock. Meanwhile, more experimental, psych-influenced pieces like &ldquo;Run Run Blood,&rdquo; the harrowing Steve Reich-sample-driven &ldquo;Barking Dog,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Funeral Pyre&rdquo; (a re-working of longtime live staple &ldquo;Intro&rdquo; that, fittingly, opens the album) somehow are perfectly at ease alongside the darkly beautiful, cathartic ballad &ldquo;Destroyer,&rdquo; all capturing themes of heartbreak, anguish and perseverance; second single &ldquo;Same Old Blues,&rdquo; the smoky, menacing duet &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mine,&rdquo; and the icy determination of &ldquo;Cruel World&rdquo; bring listeners back to the sample-heavy, synth-driven Phantogram sound that has found them an extensive, dedicated fan base.<\/p>\n<p>An iridescent record that glows with warmth even as it explores the desolation of personal pain, Three is the latest chapter in Phantogram&rsquo;s impressive ascent to the forefront of alternative pop&mdash;as well as proof that nothing, at this point, can hold them back.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Phantogram_1_09_21_PM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Phantogram"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.phantogram.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Phantogram"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/phantogram\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1l9d7B8W0IHy3LqWsxP2SH"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/phantogrammusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:16 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"cheap-trick":{"id":"3820","name":"Cheap Trick","friendly_url":"cheap-trick","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p>Cheap Trick is part of the very fiber of American music, inspiring and delighting generations with their unique union of massive melodies and razorblade riffs, their own special brand of mischievous wit and maximum rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. Frontlined since 1974 by Robin Zander (vocals, rhythm guitar), Rick Nielsen (lead guitar), and Tom Petersson (bass guitar), the Rockford, IL-born band is set to impact still another era with the spectacular new BANG ZOOM CRAZY&hellip;HELLO, their 17<sup>th<\/sup> studio collection and first in more than five years. Co-produced by Cheap Trick and GRAMMY&reg; Award winner Julian Raymond (Glen Campbell, Fastball), songs like &ldquo;Heart On The Line&rdquo; and the turbulent first single, &ldquo;When I Wake Up Tomorrow,&rdquo; are deeply connected to the band&rsquo;s own irrepressible history just as they accelerate their trademark sound and vision into the now. The glorious &ldquo;Long Time No See Ya&rdquo; marks another in a long line of salutations spanning &ldquo;ELO Kiddies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hello There&rdquo; to &ldquo;Goodnight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Say Goodbye,&rdquo; while the piledriving &ldquo;Do You Believe Me&rdquo; showcases dueling solos from Nielsen and six-string icon Wayne Kramer &ndash; a milestone meeting of the long established Midwestern mutual appreciation society between Cheap Trick and the mighty MC5. BANG ZOOM CRAZY&hellip;HELLO prove Cheap Trick to be as energetic and idiosyncratically irresistible as ever before, a callback to their classic canon yet somehow as inventive and exciting as a bunch of crazy kids just coming out of the garage.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We wanted to make something that was new and fresh but also going back to our 70s sound and feel,&rdquo; Zander says, &ldquo;this Midwestern rock band that&rsquo;s got a hard edge but still plays pop music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s loud and it&rsquo;s noisy,&rdquo; Nielsen says, &ldquo;which is exactly what we are. It sounds like there&rsquo;s a lot going on but really it&rsquo;s just a three piece band with a great singer.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Cheap Trick are of course a indisputable institution, beloved for their instantly identifiable, hugely influential, powerhouse pop rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. The constant core of the band remains one of a kind &ndash; three guys, four chords, and tunes that will last in perpetuity, from &ldquo;He&rsquo;s A Whore,&rdquo; &ldquo;California Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dream Police&rdquo; to &ldquo;Surrender,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Want You To Want Me&rdquo; and the worldwide #1 hit single, &ldquo;The Flame.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The songs are why everybody knows Cheap Trick,&rdquo; Nielsen says. &ldquo;We have some good songs. &lsquo;I Want You To Want Me&rdquo; has been around for 40 years but people still love it. And even if you&rsquo;re sick of it, it&rsquo;s over in three minutes! The songs are still relevant, they still have the right words and the right emotion to move 99% of all humans.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Amidst that not inconsiderable demographic, one particular fan served as catalyst for Cheap Trick&rsquo;s return to the studio. Founder, president, and CEO of Nashville-based Big Machine Records, Scott Borchetta has also been a lifelong supporter of the band. Conversations began in 2012 and were sealed when veteran producer\/songwriter Julian Raymond &ndash; a longtime Cheap Trick associate and Academy Award nominee for co-writing the GRAMMY&reg;-winning &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Not Gonna Miss You,&rdquo; featured in 2014&rsquo;s acclaimed documentary, <em>Glen Campbell: I&rsquo;ll Be Me<\/em> &ndash; joined the zeitgeist-defining label as its Vice President of A&amp;R. A multi-album deal was soon struck, a contract as rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth for any rock band in the modern era let alone one of Cheap Trick&rsquo;s considerable vintage.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty big career tool,&rdquo; Nielsen says. &ldquo;Much better than putting a bunch of CDs in my car.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great working with Scott,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a music lover. It&rsquo;s rare for the guy that&rsquo;s running the label to be so musical. Usually we have to battle it out with those guys but he left us alone. He was like, I love your band, you know what you&rsquo;re doing in there.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Deal in hand, Cheap Trick and Raymond quickly set to work. Described by all as the band&rsquo;s de-facto &ldquo;fifth member,&rdquo; Raymond has been a friend and sometimes collaborator for three decades, relied upon as both confidante and traffic cop.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We could produce our own records but we prefer to have Julian there to quell the storms,&rdquo; Zander says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got three writers in the band so there&rsquo;s a lot of ideas floating around. You&rsquo;ve got to have somebody that&rsquo;s outside of the band to help give some direction. Otherwise you just get lost in yourselves.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Julian really brings the best out in us,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;He really understands our band and because he&rsquo;s not us, he can see things that we don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t see in ourselves. We&rsquo;re so close to this music, you need somebody else like Julian.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Sessions got underway in 2015 at Los Angeles&rsquo; East West Studio. The band immediately got into their groove by locking into a playful version of &ldquo;The In Crowd.&rdquo; Written by Billy Page and made famous in not one, not two, but <em>three<\/em> distinct chart hits by Dobie Gray, the Ramsey Lewis Trio, and Bryan Ferry respectively, the song was a staple of Cheap Trick&rsquo;s earliest live sets, a reliable crowd-pleaser as they made their bones at local dives all over the Midwest.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The feel started there,&rdquo; Zander says. &ldquo;We continued writing from that sound.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>All three original members cite drummer Daxx Nielsen as the most significant contemporary influence on Cheap Trick&rsquo;s current creativity. A musical polymath who has played with artists spanning Dick Dale to Brandi Carlisle, the younger Nielsen was the obvious choice when the seemingly irreplaceable Bun E. Carlos retired from active touring and recording with the band he co-founded. Daxx&rsquo;s innate virtuosity and spirited musicianship were propulsive in more ways than the usual, inspiring fresh energy while also keeping the band in touch with its roots.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Daxx is so talented,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so into it, he can play all of our songs on any instrument. We&rsquo;ll pull something from our back catalog and <em>he&rsquo;ll<\/em> tell <em>us<\/em> how the bridge goes.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have to <em>recall<\/em> stuff,&rdquo; Rick says. &ldquo;Daxx <em>remembers<\/em>.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After more than half a decade away from the studio, Cheap Trick was fired up and ridiculously prolific, cranking out close to 30 new tunes over two pair of sessions in Los Angeles and Nashville. Tracks like &ldquo;No Direction Home&rdquo; hit hard as a teenage crush&rsquo;s kiss, affirming the eternal strength of Cheap Trick&rsquo;s smart, sly, sometimes sarcastic songcraft. Each member has skin in the songwriting game, contributing elements &ndash; a riff, a chorus, a hook that won&rsquo;t stop &ndash; which are then jammed into three-and-a-half minute pop perfection by the entire unit, ensuring everybody&rsquo;s respective two cents are represented in every finished tune.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We start something and the songs take on a life of their own,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of back and forth. It&rsquo;s not like one person had to think of everything for 40 years straight. I think that keeps us in top form.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Fast approaching their fifth decade, Cheap Trick is among the most active and successful in music history, with featured appearances on over 20 movie soundtracks, more than 40 international gold and platinum certifications, myriad awards and industry honors, and total record sales well in excess of 20 million. BANG ZOOM CRAZY&hellip;HELLO arrives just as the band are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a long overdue honor that confirms their incredible influence while simultaneously acknowledging the millions upon millions of Cheap Trick fans around the planet.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty amazing,&rdquo; Nielsen says. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t some goal we were trying to achieve &ndash; it&rsquo;s kind of out of the blue. It means a lot to a lot of people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;People are so overwhelmed by it,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;They come up to me at the grocery store or at the bank, saying congratulations, that&rsquo;s the greatest thing ever. It really means a lot to our fans.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Surely on any shortlist of rock&rsquo;s all time greatest live acts, Cheap Trick will take to the road in celebration of their electric new album, traveling as they have for decades, rocking arenas, concert halls, and amphitheatres worldwide more than 150 nights each year. BANG ZOOM CRAZY&hellip;HELLO affirms Cheap Trick as an indefatigable going concern, not merely Hall of Fame-worthy legends but a vital and vibrant fact of life.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever see us quitting,&rdquo; Zander says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not cut out for sitting around and watching TV.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is what we do,&rdquo; Petersson says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very proud of this record, we have no problem going around the world playing songs from it. We&rsquo;re going to do that anyway. That&rsquo;s what we do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a nostalgia band,&rdquo; Nielsen says. &ldquo;We never stopped making records, we never stopped touring. We&rsquo;ve had ups, we&rsquo;ve had super lows, but we kept at it and I think people appreciate that. Sometimes I think we&rsquo;re just too dumb to quit. We just keep going.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CheapTrick_5_07_42_PM_3_15_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 8 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 8","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cheaptrick"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.cheaptrick.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cheaptrick"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCSomIwKuzh9QOMKsLTHemcg"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/officialcheaptrick\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1LB8qB5BPb3MHQrfkvifXU"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:31 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"grizzly-bear":{"id":"3826","name":"Grizzly Bear","friendly_url":"grizzly-bear","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>When Grizzly Bear came to the end of the road with their fourth album, 2012's 'Shields',<br \/>the future was unclear.

I wanted to be making music with my band again. I stayed<br \/>busy, I wrote a cook book, produced other people, but my favorite thing to do was work<br \/>with my band. I was getting bored over here.&rdquo; He laughs. While all four members were<br \/>strewn across their various corners, he took it upon himself to start a cloud account &ndash;<br \/>essentially a dropbox. The intention was to allow the band a gentler entry point for<br \/>starting to think about coming together again. It was new for them, less pressurized, far<br \/>more relaxed and a guaranteed prevention measure against creative stalemate. The<br \/>dropbox was a home for inspiration, mood boards, ideas for music, demos, even songs.<br \/>It was, however, quite a slow process, starting in March 2015. &ldquo;Painfully slow,&rdquo; chuckles<br \/>Taylor. They did have one song &ndash; 'Losing All Sense' &ndash; that made it to the record, but<br \/>Rossen was reticent to call this the beginning of something. The word 'album' was a<br \/>forbidden utterance at this point in time. &ldquo;We got into the water with one toe at a time to<br \/>avoid freaking everyone out,&rdquo; recalls Taylor. &ldquo;Yeah this time around we came to it<br \/>slowly,&rdquo; agrees Rossen. &ldquo;Tip-toeing towards a conversation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chris Taylor started this motherfucker,&rdquo; adds Droste. &ldquo;I'm so grateful to him because I<br \/>don't know whether it would have organically happened otherwise.&rdquo; Taylor even bought<br \/>a guitar after five months of little progress and wrote in Big Sur. The song 'Sky Took<br \/>Hold' got its start in one of those sessions. Taylor wrote the song 'Systole' during his<br \/>time in Berlin, and it is his first lead vocal for the band. &ldquo;I learned guitar so I could write<br \/>songs for the band,&rdquo; he says, as eager as he was then to be in conversation about<br \/>Grizzly Bear. Once that catalyst came, there was still the question of whether or not it<br \/>was going to work. &ldquo;I'm of the mindset that I never know if we'll make another album, no<br \/>matter how good or bad things are,&rdquo; says Droste. &ldquo;In a way it's a miracle this album<br \/>happened because for a while it was to be decided. When it started to come together<br \/>there were a lot of ideas. Some didn't work. Eventually when things started to work we<br \/>were like, 'Oh my god it's happening.'&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That relief, that momentum, that sense of a band really relishing the chance to relocate<br \/>their mojo is apparent on the album, which wound up taking two years to make, via<br \/>remote writing trips taken variously by Taylor and Droste, and Bear and Rossen, then a<br \/>retreat to Allaire Studios in New York in June 2016 once there was more of a cohesive<br \/>collection of songs. That's where they recorded a lot of 2009's 'Veckatimest'. In addition<br \/>to Allaire, they recorded in Vox Studios in Hollywood and at Taylor's LA studio in Echo<br \/>Park. Rossen also continued to track parts for the record at his home upstate.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was so exciting when it was starting to work,&rdquo; says Droste. Perhaps what was<br \/>different this time around was the communication barriers were set free. There was a<br \/>nakedness to receiving each other's ideas and a lack of tying expectations to particular<br \/>results. The whole affair was positively zen. &ldquo;I was coming at it like &ndash; I have to be open<br \/>with everything,&rdquo; says Droste. &ldquo;Let's try anything and let it go. If it doesn't work, it doesn't<br \/>work. Don't be precious or get upset when other bandmates don't like it. Keep trying.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The resulting fifth Grizzly Bear album 'Painted Ruins' benefits from having the songs<br \/>develop in a completely organic way. &ldquo;We had a lot of fun making the record,&rdquo; says<br \/>Rossen. &ldquo;Even though there are serious themes we tried to keep the sound as light as<br \/>possible. Maybe it's a matter of being a little older and not assuming that there should be<br \/>so much wrapped up in what we were doing.&rdquo; That's what immediately bleeds forth when<br \/>you listen through to the eleven tracks. &ldquo;Does it sound totally different?&rdquo; asks Droste,<br \/>champing at the bit to get the juggernaut started again. &ldquo;More inviting?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed there's a deep warmth, a flirtatiousness to the sonic ideas, and a sense of<br \/>playfulness that's perhaps the most surprising of all. It's a direct reflection of the joy they<br \/>experienced while making it. It chimes with collective exhales, and the genuine love that<br \/>came from reuniting with old friends. &ldquo;You forget that you have this great thing going on<br \/>with us, even though it can be really difficult,&rdquo; says Droste. &ldquo;When we finally got together<br \/>it felt like there was a musical chemistry that was as real as it was when we were kids.<br \/>That was thrilling in a way that was still the case,&rdquo; adds Rossen. You could almost say<br \/>that the band's propensity to chuck lots of ideas at the wall to see which ones stuck was<br \/>the closest an established act can get to tapping into that energy that exists while<br \/>recording a debut.<\/p>\n<p>For all four members the results of the sessions were unexpected. Droste points to<br \/>'Mourning Sound' and closing track 'Sky Took Hold'. &ldquo;That song was fleshed out in a<br \/>very different way, then one day they added an ominous horn section that repeats and it<br \/>changed the whole thing for me,&rdquo; says Droste. &ldquo;That's what I love about working with<br \/>them. They just have ideas I would never have, and vice versa. It's a challenge to be in a<br \/>democratic band with strong opinions but I also thank god because we get all these<br \/>different creative ideas that don't come naturally. It's very much four people. It always<br \/>has been. It always will for as long as we continue on. These are the three people who<br \/>continually surprise me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Rossen came up with the title 'Painted Ruins'. As usual, the band are more comfortable<br \/>leaving the visuals, the lyrics, the themes to the listener's imagination, so you can take<br \/>from their art what you will. &ldquo;I don't relate to a lot of explicit storytelling music,&rdquo; explains<br \/>Droste, before making up something on the spot. &ldquo;'Her name was Jenny and she broke<br \/>my heart and then I went on a cruise&hellip;' Ok, don't know Jenny, haven't been on a cruise!&rdquo;<br \/>Instead 'Painted Ruins' has a different meaning to each member of the band. &ldquo;It's the<br \/>idea of dressing up something that's falling apart and making something out of a<br \/>situation that's crumbling,&rdquo; says Rossen. &ldquo;In a way that's how a lot of this music came<br \/>together. Some of it was a pastiche and it found its way into a cohesive form.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>There's also clearly a connotation with the general breakdown that's happening in the<br \/>wider world, which can also be mirrored in the band's lives as they reached their late<br \/>thirties. &ldquo;We all were hoping to achieve a sense of personal decay or breakdown<br \/>representing a larger whole or situation, not necessarily writing topical music but writing<br \/>personal music that could represent larger strife,&rdquo; adds Rossen. For Bear, the album is<br \/>about personal reflection. &ldquo;Observing yourself,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Seeing how you're<br \/>interacting when you're going through change. It's not a breakup record or a social<br \/>commentary record, there's a lot of sides to the human experience.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>'Painted Ruins' isn't a passing pleasure, it's a body of work intended to be lived in. Its<br \/>psychedelic grooves, challenging composition and pensive lyrics require repeated listens<br \/>and develop significance, attachment and deep-rooted appreciation over time. That said<br \/>it strays from getting too intense or introspective. Some of the tracks take on a more<br \/>personal bent. The likes of 'Wasted Acres' and 'Neighbors', the former of which is about<br \/>Rossen's life in upstate New York. &ldquo;That tune started as a simple and direct lyric about<br \/>collecting firewood with my dog,&rdquo; says Rossen. 'Four Cypresses', on the other hand, with<br \/>its refrain of &ldquo;it's chaos but it works&rdquo; is more political, though the band would prefer to<br \/>keep the overtones less explicit.<\/p>\n<p>Droste has been a staunch advocate for politics online via social media these past few<br \/>years. The band recognize the importance of that but don't feel that it necessarily needs<br \/>to be written into the music. &ldquo;As soon as the Election was over I thought about how<br \/>valuable it is to be able to connect with other people through music,&rdquo; says Rossen, who's<br \/>anticipating touring this record more than anything. &ldquo;It's even more valuable in this<br \/>political climate, where you can impart a sense of shared experience, compassion,<br \/>empathy or just humanity. You look at the news every day and it feels overwhelming and<br \/>truly bleak, you feel like giving up. There's a huge value in the ability to make something<br \/>that connects with other people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Having met with so many accolades that would have been deemed unfathomable to<br \/>them in the early days, you wonder what Grizzly Bear set out to achieve with another<br \/>album. They opened for Radiohead on their debut (&ldquo;a total mindfuck&rdquo; according to<br \/>Droste). They played Radio City Music Hall on their last record 'Shields'. Are there any<br \/>tangibles they'd love to chase? &ldquo;I'd just like to reach new people,&rdquo; says Droste, simply. &ldquo;I<br \/>want to grow. A lot of writing has to do with selfish reasons. Getting shit out of your<br \/>system, self-therapy. My favorite thing of all is the performing and the connection.&rdquo; For<br \/>Rossen, it's all about the music. &ldquo;If we can continue working together and enjoy what<br \/>we're making and feel that it's vital to us, if we can do that in a sustained way that's<br \/>about as much as I can hope for.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Taylor, on the other hand, wears his heart firmly on his sleeve. &ldquo;I'm excited that I'm<br \/>better friends with everyone in the band than ever,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Life is too short not to<br \/>enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing. We&rsquo;re in a lucky situation.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GrizzlyBear_12_34_21_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 27 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 27","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/grizzlybear\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/grizzlybear\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2Jv5eshHtLycR6R8KQCdc4"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grizzlybear"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/grizzly-bear.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCZRUTFtK26wgbWIbmBCo4Kw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"spoon":{"id":"3829","name":"Spoon","friendly_url":"spoon","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p><em>Hot Thoughts<\/em>, Spoon&rsquo;s 9th album, is the bravest, most sonically inventive work of their career, though keep in mind,&nbsp;Britt Daniel has already overseen a number of other reincarnations.

Anticipation,&nbsp;fantasy,&nbsp;longing&mdash;in some ways, these emotions of desire&nbsp;are&nbsp;more powerful than any trophy. But it&rsquo;s not like we&nbsp;have a choice in the matter; love, as it&rsquo;s been said, is all chemistry. In fact, it&rsquo;s mostly a tiny&nbsp;chemical messenger called dopamine&nbsp;that pulls our heartstrings and drives our&nbsp;acts of romance. And&nbsp;so&nbsp;that&rsquo;s just what&nbsp;the rising maestro B&Oslash;RNS&nbsp;titled&nbsp;his debut full-length album&nbsp;of majestic, lovelorn anthems.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;Dopamine&nbsp;is released&nbsp;when you are longing for something,&nbsp;the desire of a reward&mdash;it's the fantasy in your mind,&rdquo;&nbsp;says&nbsp;B&Oslash;RNS.&nbsp;&ldquo;The old&nbsp;&lsquo;you want most what you can&rsquo;t have&rsquo;&nbsp;expression.&nbsp;A lot of the songs on the album are about wanting her but not being able to have&nbsp;her:&nbsp;&lsquo;come back to me&rsquo;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lsquo;I wish I had you&rsquo;&nbsp;songs.&nbsp; All the songs are inspired by a chemical connection to a lover,&nbsp;so dopamine is the all-encompassing theme.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">B&Oslash;RNS, a&nbsp;Michigan native&nbsp;who spent time in&nbsp;New York before landing in his new home of Los Angeles, is&nbsp;a preternatural talent.&nbsp;He&nbsp;understands&nbsp;instinctively&nbsp;how to connect&nbsp;the intricacies of&nbsp;a&nbsp;melody&nbsp;to the sensual receptors in the human ear,&nbsp;and how to&nbsp;conjure&nbsp;up a&nbsp;song&nbsp;from its building blocks to&nbsp;reach&nbsp;the heavens. Working with&nbsp;the&nbsp;producer Tommy English, in 2014&nbsp;B&Oslash;RNS&nbsp;released the&nbsp;Candy&nbsp;EP,&nbsp;a shot of&nbsp;sunny, sweet,&nbsp;sweeping adrenaline&nbsp;to the pop music landscape that put &ldquo;10,000 Emerald&nbsp;Pools&rdquo; (produced by Kennedy) and &ldquo;Electric Love&rdquo; on playlists&nbsp;across the world. The latter even famously earned a fan in&nbsp;Taylor Swift, who&nbsp;tweeted about the song&rsquo;s&nbsp;immediate&nbsp;gravity&nbsp;to her millions of followers. Recognizing something special, the Borns-English pair&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;began work on&nbsp;an&nbsp;album, writing and recording in between the steadily&nbsp;growing&nbsp;live shows, and with the stage in mind. Enamored of and inspired by his new home on the west coast, B&Oslash;RNS injected much of that sunshine vibe into the new music.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While recording&nbsp;Dopamine,&nbsp;B&Oslash;RNS&nbsp;was drawn to a stack of vintage&nbsp;Playboymagazines&nbsp;lying around&nbsp;the studio,&nbsp;and&nbsp;he&nbsp;became&nbsp;captivated by the classiness and&nbsp;seductive, suggestive advertisements and editorial&nbsp;messages from that bygone era.&nbsp;And as the son of an advertising firm owner, B&Oslash;RNS acknowledges that the ability to connect a message simply and directly to an audience has&nbsp;been with him his entire life, which comes through in his lyrics.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inspired by the pairing of words and phrases together to be clear, concise, and simplified,&rdquo; says B&Oslash;RNS. &ldquo;Those &rsquo;60s and&nbsp;&rsquo;70s&nbsp;era&nbsp;Playboys,&nbsp;the way they&rsquo;re put together with film photography,&nbsp;the articles, the way they advertise products&mdash;they&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;explain it to you situationally. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re lounging on your balcony as the&nbsp;sun is slowly setting, drinking a Mai Tai, and there she is&hellip;&rsquo; Everything is very sensual and clever.&nbsp;Flipping through those influenced the&nbsp;mood of a few songs on the record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One such number is&nbsp;Dopamine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holy Ghost,&rdquo; with its twinkling keyboards, Zapp-funk pops, synthesized drum rolls, and precise, macho riffs. In a confident, yearning falsetto, B&Oslash;RNS sings: &ldquo;Let me satisfy your soul\/I&rsquo;m not a saint but do I have to be\/Baby, you&rsquo;re my holy ghost\/and I need you close, come back to me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;American Money,&rdquo;&nbsp;a song for which B&Oslash;RNS&nbsp;had written the verses&nbsp;on acoustic guitar before bringing&nbsp;it into a session with&nbsp;English, is a twist on a common thematic standard in modern music: cash. &ldquo;The chorus came out of &lsquo;The paradise in your eyes,&nbsp;green like American money&rsquo;;&nbsp;like saying,&nbsp;&lsquo;Darling,&nbsp;you look like a million bucks,&rsquo;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s the green in her eyes, the greener pasture,&nbsp;she is the promised land. And when&nbsp;Tommy put this darker, down-tempo hip-hop beat behind it, the song took this moodier route.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While the mood of&nbsp;Dopamine&nbsp;is very much about love and its chemical pathways, it is not always overt or obvious in its approach. B&Oslash;RNS admits he never sets out to write a certain type of song, but rather lets the sentiment flow out of him in the moment. &ldquo;I guess love, or longing for connection, is something that naturally happens when I&rsquo;m writing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I want to keep the songs poetic, in a pop-song context, but to still be able to be poems without the music, and live with visual imagery. I like how things look on paper as much as they sound.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Look to &ldquo;The Emotion&rdquo; for an example of such a context: &ldquo;Shadows fill my mind up\/Zeroes tell me my time&rsquo;s up\/I lost count so long ago\/Maybe my heart&rsquo;s numb\/Don&rsquo;t hold my hands accountable\/They&rsquo;re young and they&rsquo;re dumb.&rdquo; That a B&Oslash;RNS song can carry in it such profound simplicity and far-reaching layers of grandness is a testament to the true lightning in a bottle at work. He sings about that same contained electricity in &ldquo;Electric Love,&rdquo; which he calls simply &ldquo;the fantasy of a girl in the enchanted forest of my mind&rdquo;: &ldquo;Drown me, you make my heart beat like the rain\/Surround me, hold me deep beneath your waves.&rdquo; The song&rsquo;s early success has been impressive, but it may only be just beginning to rise, with syncs and shares continuing to skyrocket. &ldquo;I never expected so many people to connect to it,&rdquo; says B&Oslash;RNS, his awe and pride sincere and palpable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On his thoughts about finishing&nbsp;Dopamine, B&Oslash;RNS is quick to share the joy and credit with others, especially his producer, English. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be happier that I made my first album with someone I consider such a good friend,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Tommy is so talented and we put a lot of thought, hours, blood, and sweat into this. It came from a very honest place that I really believe in artistically. It&rsquo;s a good feeling to go to LA, a completely foreign land, and form a strong musical bond.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The bright, majestic, lovelorn anthems of B&Oslash;RNS are sure to pull our heartstrings and drive our acts of romance throughout 2015 and beyond.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BRNS_10_51_51_AM_3_6_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bornsmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bornsmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1KP6TWI40m7p3QBTU6u2xo"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bornsmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.bornsmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BORNSOfficialVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:45 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"yonder-mountain-string-band":{"id":"3977","name":"Yonder Mountain String Band","friendly_url":"yonder-mountain-string-band","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Yonder Mountain String Band's first new album in two years,&nbsp;<em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE<\/em>&nbsp;is undeniably the Colorado-based progressive bluegrass outfit's most surprising, creative, and yes,&nbsp;<em>energetic<\/em>&nbsp;studio excursion to date. Songs like \"Chasing My Tail\" and \"Alison\" are rooted in tradition but as current as tomorrow, animated by electrifying performance, vivid production, and the modernist power that has made Yonder one of the most popular live bands of their generation. Melding sophisticated songcraft, irrepressible spirit, and remarkable instrumental ability,&nbsp;<em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE&nbsp;<\/em>is a testament to Yonder Mountain String Band's organic, dynamic, and intensely personal brand of contemporary bluegrass-fueled Americana.<br \/><br \/>\"I think this is our best album yet,\" says Adam Aijala, guitarist.<br \/><br \/>Yonder founding members Aijala, banjo player Dave Johnston, and bassist Ben Kaufmann reconfigured Yonder Mountain String Band as a traditional bluegrass instrumental five-piece in 2014 with the recruitment of new players Allie Kral (violin) and Jacob Jolliff (mandolin). The reconstituted group debuted with 2015's acclaimed&nbsp;<em>BLACK SHEEP<\/em>, but truly gelled as they toured, the new players' personalities seamlessly blending and elevating the intrinsically tight Yonder sound. Yonder made certain to show off the current roster's growing strength with the 2017 release of&nbsp;<em>MOUNTAIN TRACKS: VOLUME 6<\/em>, the first installment in their hugely popular live recording series since 2008.<br \/><br \/>\"This lineup just keeps getting better,\" Aijala says. \"The more gigs you get under your belt, the better you get. Obviously. But the confidence I have in these individual musicians, I'm amazed at some of the places we go together on stage.\"<br \/><br \/><em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE<\/em>&nbsp;is produced by Yonder Mountain String Band and longtime collaborator John McVey, with the majority of the album recorded at Coupe Studios in Yonder's home base of Boulder, CO. Aijala and McVey handled all of the album's mix and engineering at their respective home studios and while Yonder was on the road -- the second time a Yonder member has taken on the technical task.<br \/><br \/>\"John taught me a lot when we worked together on our last album,\" Aijala says. \"So this time around, I felt a lot more confident.\"<br \/><br \/>Like virtually all aspects of Yonder Mountain String Band's unlikely artistic methodology,&nbsp;<em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE<\/em>&nbsp;is a fully collaborative effort, its original songs credited to the core founding trio of Aijala, Johnston, and Kaufmann, regardless of combination or specific input.<br \/><br \/>\"I think it removes the jockeying for songs on a record,\" says Aijala. \"We're all of the mind that even if one of us wrote a great song, if not for Yonder, would anyone get a chance to hear it? It works better this way. All three of us grew up playing team sports so we're team players -- everyone wants what's best for the band.\"<br \/><br \/>Laced with interstitial dialogue, music, sound effects, and other overlapping ephemera,&nbsp;<em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE<\/em>&nbsp;is by design Yonder's most ingenious studio collection thus far. Songs like \"Take A Chance On Me\" and the heavy metal-inspired breakdown, \"Fall Outta Line,\" see the quintet touching upon FM pop, country rock, funk, world music, and so much more; adopting traditional sonic and lyrical idioms to mask deeper and darker personal truths.<br \/><br \/>\"It's a little more eclectic,\" Aijala says. \"None of us grew up with bluegrass so there are always other influences in there. I think this record is a bit more reminiscent of our live show, with different genres and different types of songs.\"<br \/><br \/>Indeed, \"Last of the Railroad Men\" plays like a lost narrative country classic while the unprecedented \"Groovin' Away\" closes LOVE. AIN'T LOVE with a summery sense of joyous optimism. Yonder's first-ever original reggae song, the track stands out as yet another shining example of the band's lifelong commitment to anything-goes artistic freedom.<br \/><br \/>\"There are no limits to what we do\" says Aijala. \"We'll try anything, if it feels good, we'll try it again.\"<br \/><br \/>In addition to the founding trio's songwriting efforts, Jolliff -- who arrived to play on&nbsp;<em>BLACK SHEEP<\/em>sessions and never left -- contributed a pair of fiery instrumentals and also lends vocals to a delightful cover of King Harvest's eternal \"Dancing In The Moonlight.\"<br \/><br \/>\"Allie sang a song that we wrote on&nbsp;<em>BLACK SHEEP<\/em>,\" Aijala says, \"so we wanted to showcase Jake's vocals on this album. We've been playing 'Dancing in the Moonlight' in our live shows and whenever we play it people just light up. We always enjoy playing it, the harmonies are really good and Jake sings the hell out of it so we thought, why not put it on the record?\"<br \/><br \/>2017 will see Yonder continue its seemingly endless touring, leading towards next year's 20th anniversary of their initial coming together, an irrefutably momentous occasion.<br \/><br \/>\"When we were first starting, our creativity was rooted in rebelliousness. Now, there's a greater conscious awareness and attention to detail that we're bringing to our writing and recording. Our nature and instincts remain progressive. We're just doing it in a way that's sharper, more musical, and way more satisfying,\" says Ben Kaufmann.<br \/><br \/>With its melodic flair, expert technique, and forward-thinking fervor,&nbsp;<em>LOVE. AIN'T LOVE<\/em>&nbsp;is a strikingly assured and well-crafted manifestation of Yonder's matchless musical vision. Nearly two decades in, Yonder Mountain String Band is still utterly unto themselves, a one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-lifetime combo whose inventiveness, versatility, and sheer imagination shows no sign of winding down.<br \/><br \/>\"We've talked about this,\" Aijala says, \"and we all feel like we could play in Yonder until we can't play anymore. As long we still have new ideas, as long as we're still creating something that's fresh to us, I don't see any reason to stop.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_YonderMountainStringBand_8_13_34_AM_4_3_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/yondermountain"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/yondermountain.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/yondermountain"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/YonderMountainSB"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yondermountain\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1ReHC2jB2DGoPbMYhzuFuO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 12:53:21 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-fray":{"id":"3856","name":"The Fray","friendly_url":"the-fray","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>\"Helios,\" the fourth album from critically acclaimed foursome The Fray, will be released February 25, 2014, on Epic Records. Of the new music, produced by Stuart Price (The Killers, Madonna, Keane), Isaac Slade (piano, vocals) notes, \"Working with Stuart was the best of both worlds. We brought our organic instruments, and he brought his arsenal of electronic antiques. This record is all about running to the front lines of what we've done and pushing our borders even farther. Electronic instruments, drum samples, enormous backing vocals, opening up our writing to folks outside our camp.\"&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> The band premiered the lead single \"Love Don't Die,\" produced by Ryan Tedder (Adele, One Republic), on the \"Today Show.\" A flurry of TV performances followed the release as the band performed on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" rang in the New Year as part the global TV celebration \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2014,\" and recently performed on the outdoor stage at \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"The Late Show with David Letterman.\"&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Most recently, the band performed alongside Pussy Riot as part of Amnesty International's Bring Human Rights Home show at Barclay's Center in Brooklyn, NY. Guitarist Joe King explained the importance of the evening, \"To me, [Pussy Riot] made me realize how apathetic I can get as an American,\" King said. \"You can get real critical or not do anything about what you think should change and just let things happen. They're doing the opposite. They're going public... It's inspiring to see that. I think that, if anything, it motivates. It should motivate people to do something.\"&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> The Fray is Slade, Joe King (guitar, vocals), Dave Welsh (guitar), and Ben Wysocki (drums). The Denver-based group formed in 2002 after high school friends Slade and King bumped into each other at a local guitar shop. The Fray achieved national success with their 2005 debut, featuring the hit singles \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" and \"How to Save a Life,\" which went double-platinum. The band also earned a 2010 Grammy nomination for their self-titled release.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_FrayThe_9_43_56_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheFray"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.thefray.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thefray"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thefray"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/TheFray\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/0Aq0GzP80LvBbFqGp2kZDa"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:09 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"hellyeah":{"id":"3830","name":"HELLYEAH","friendly_url":"hellyeah","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p><strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong>&rsquo;s previous album, 2014's <em>Blood for Blood,<\/em> was the album metal fans and critics were waiting for <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong> to make, based on the revered metal pedigree of the individual members. Such an artistic achievement&mdash;the album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hard Rock album chart&mdash; meant the band set the bar incredibly high. &nbsp;<strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong> &mdash;whose core is comprised of singer Chad Gray, guitarist Tom Maxwell, drummer Vinnie Paul, Christian Brady (guitar) and Kyle Sanders (bass)&mdash; do not disappoint with their fifth album <em>UNDEN!ABLE.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\"We turned a corner with <em>Blood for Blood <\/em>and we wanted to continue that path,\" Paul states. \"It's much heavier and darker, and we take it to another extreme.\" The album also fosters a sense of community and the notion that \"we're all in this together\" among the metal community we are part of. The upside down \"i\" in the title is an exclamation point &mdash; a subtle indicator of how metal fans live their lives against the grain for their entire daily existence. \"It doesn&rsquo;t matter how old you are &mdash; you are <em>always<\/em> a metal kid,\" Chad Gray declares, referencing himself <em>and<\/em> fans as one.<\/p>\n<p>With the 2007 self-titled debut, <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong> broke the ice, introducing the world to a band comprised of familiar faces who played in influential bands with signature sounds. 2010's <em>Stampede<\/em> showed off a more pleasure-seeking side of <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong>. 2012's <em>Band of Brothers<\/em> was marked by internal change and further experimentation, while <em>Blood for Blood<\/em> found the band reaching the summit of brutality, creativity, and artfully mined piss and vinegar. <em>UNDEN!ABLE<\/em> is the logical next step and it's frontloaded with songs that crackle with a palpable industrial aggro energy. As guitarist Maxwell succinctly says, \"It's belligerent and brutal, with peaks and valleys that bring you up and down, emotionally and lyrically.\"<\/p>\n<p>One reason it's so belligerent and brutal? The time crunch that came along with crafting the album. The band spent 18 glorious but grueling months on the road in support of <em>Blood for Blood<\/em> and was given exactly two weeks (!!!) off before it had to start working on <em>UNDEN!ABLE<\/em>. The pressure and lack of recess awakened a sleeping giant within Maxwell. There was literally no time to waste and he marshalled his emotions for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>Without any time to decompress, Maxwell came out of the gates in sniper mode, admitting there was \"no time for demo-itis!\" He confessed, \"I was pissed, agitated, and distraught. In the long run, it helped. There was so much intensity in the frustration.\" &nbsp;Paul notes that the band \"took no time off so that we didn't get complacent. We knew there was a window of opportunity.\" It may not have been optimal at the time, but it yielded a maximized result. \"We know we did great, broken ankles and all,\" he states. <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong>&rsquo;s usual formula remained unaltered when it came to the recording process. They demoed at Paul's home studio in Dallas, TX before writing and recording with Kevin Churko in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p><em>UNDEN!ABLE <\/em>hosts redemptive, but throttling songs that will \"scratch your soul,\" according to Gray. \"X\" is fast, furious and \"over the top,\" says Paul. \"It is something that metal fans need.\" It's expected to become an instant fan favorite. The more contemplative \"Human\" is moving, yet monstrous. The title track surges with raw energy and industrial crunch. \"Love Falls\" is a rhythmic and sultry departure for the band, which measures pain and anger equally, while \"STARTARIOT\" is nothing short of a fist-pumping, fuel-burning heavy metal epic.<\/p>\n<p><em>UNDEN!ABLE <\/em>is a complete work, including a cover that is the definitive visual matching the album's sonic wrath. The artwork was inspired by Chad Gray and designed by William &ldquo;Wombat&rdquo; Felch, who the band discovered through his artistic interpretations of HELLYEAH songs on YouTube, and who Paul labeled &ldquo;like a new member of the band.&rdquo; The eye is emblematic of the metal community and the kids who find their kindred spirits in <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong>. &ldquo;The eyes are the portal to the soul,\" Gray says. \"There is more extremity, so I wanted it to represent looking into the eye of someone who is a member of the metal community being cast out. You always feel like a fighter. So we created this eye and the exclamation point [in the title] as the stamp on this madness. You are looking into the soul of a metalhead.\"<\/p>\n<p>Overall, there's a surging current of hunger in <em>UNDEN!ABLE<\/em>. The members have had success in the past, but they're not satisfied with all they have done. \"It's all I know,\" Paul muses about what keeps him manning the kit and making new music, despite a career so illustrious that no one would fault him if he chose to hang up the sticks. \"I could have quit and could be playing golf. Being a traveling musician? <em>That<\/em> fuels me. I have a true passion and belief in <strong>HELLYEAH <\/strong>and heavy metal music.\"<\/p>\n<p>Gray concludes, \"We're all in this together. We are metal fans first and foremost. We play off each other every night with our metal family. As a metal kid, I'd go to shows because I <em>needed<\/em> the release. Being on the other side now, I need this as bad as the fans do. I need to hit that deck every day and give everything I can.\" &nbsp;The divide between <strong>HELLYEAH<\/strong> and their fans has been erased with <em>UNDEN!ABLE. <\/em>It's an album made <em>for<\/em> the metal community, <em>by <\/em>the metal community.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Hellyeah_3_27_40_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hellyeahband"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hellyeahofficial\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4hxDvVq5t8ebPYPdBl1F9f"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hellyeahband"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/hellyeahband.com"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/hellyeahband"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/03\/2018 09:05:24 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"buddy-guy":{"id":"3721","name":"Buddy Guy","friendly_url":"buddy-guy","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":"<p>At age 81, Buddy Guy is a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, a major influence on rock titans like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, a pioneer of Chicago&rsquo;s fabled West Side sound, and a living link to the city&rsquo;s halcyon days of electric blues. Buddy Guy has received 7 GRAMMY Awards, a 2015 Lifetime Achievement GRAMMY Award, 37 Blues Music Awards (the most any artist has received), the Billboard Magazine Century Award for distinguished artistic achievement, a Kennedy Center Honor, and the Presidential National Medal of Arts. Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #23 in its \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\"<\/p>\n<p>Buddy Guy released his latest studio album&nbsp;<em>Born To Play Guitar<\/em>&nbsp;on July 31, 2015 via Silvertone\/RCA Records, which debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquo;s Top Blues Albums chart.&nbsp; The follow-up to his 2013 first-ever double disc release,&nbsp;<em>Rhythm &amp; Blues<\/em>, which also debuted at #1 on Billboard&rsquo;s Top Blues Albums chart,&nbsp;<em>Born To Play Guitar<\/em>&nbsp;was produced by GRAMMY Award winning producer\/songwriter and Buddy&rsquo;s longtime collaborator Tom Hambridge. The release features guest appearances by Van Morrison, Joss Stone, Kim Wilson and Billy Gibbons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Though Buddy Guy will forever be associated with Chicago, his story actually begins in Louisiana. One of five children, he was born in 1936 to a sharecropper&rsquo;s family and raised on a plantation near the small town of Lettsworth, located some 140 miles northwest of New Orleans. Buddy was just seven years old when he fashioned his first makeshift &ldquo;guitar&rdquo;&mdash;a two-string contraption attached to a piece of wood and secured with his mother&rsquo;s hairpins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 1957, he took his guitar to Chicago, where he would permanently alter the direction of the instrument, first on numerous sessions for Chess Records playing alongside Howlin&rsquo; Wolf, Muddy Waters, and the rest of the label&rsquo;s legendary roster, and then on recordings of his own. His incendiary style left its mark on guitarists from Jimmy Page to John Mayer. &ldquo;He was for me what Elvis was probably like for other people,&rdquo; said Eric Clapton at Guy&rsquo;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2005. &ldquo;My course was set, and he was my pilot.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Seven years later, July 2012 proved to be one of Buddy Guy&rsquo;s most remarkable years ever. He was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honor for his lifetime contribution to American culture; earlier in the year, at a performance at the White House, he even persuaded President Obama to join him on a chorus of &ldquo;Sweet Home Chicago.&rdquo; Also in 2012, he published his long-awaited memoir,&nbsp;<em>When I Left Home<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These many years later, Buddy Guy is a genuine American treasure and one of the final surviving connections to an historic era in the country&rsquo;s musical evolution. He keeps looking to the future of the blues through his ongoing work with his 18-year-old prot&eacute;g&eacute;,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/quinnsullivanmusic.com\/\">Quinn Sullivan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I worry a lot about the legacy of Muddy, Wolf, and all the guys who created this stuff,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I want people to remember them. It's like the Ford car&mdash;Henry Ford invented the Ford car, and regardless how much technology they got on them now, you still have that little sign that says &lsquo;Ford&rsquo; on the front.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the last things Muddy Waters told me&mdash;when I found out how ill he was, I gave him a call and said, &lsquo;I'm on my way to your house.&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Don't come out here, I'm doing all right. Just keep the damn blues alive.&rsquo; They all told me that if they left here before I did, then everything was going to be on my shoulders. So as long as I'm here, I'm going to do whatever I can to keep it alive.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BuddyGuy_1_27_32_PM_2_23_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 30 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 30","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/therealbuddyguy"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.buddyguy.net\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/therealbuddyguy"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BuddyGuyVevo"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/therealbuddyguy"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2gCsNOpiBaMNh20jQ5prf0"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:29 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"kane-brown":{"id":"3744","name":"Kane Brown","friendly_url":"kane-brown","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>Even before signing his record deal in early 2016, rising star Kane Brown had already established a passionate online following in the millions.

For nearly three decades, Frankie Beverly and Maze have been creating music that is original and innovative, an instantly recognizable brand of music that has given the group a solid, steadfast and loyal audience that remains constantly supportive year in and year out. One of the most influential groups in the world of contemporary music, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly continue to perform regularly in concert and at major festivals, drawing capacity crowds every time.<\/p>\n<p>Says Philadelphia native Frankie, &ldquo;When you hang in there as we have as recording artists and what I call &lsquo;peaceful road warriors,&rsquo; you get more than you could ever imagine. We&rsquo;ve been on the road for twenty-six years as recording artists and when you come and see us, you get the real deal. You can&rsquo;t stop the love we get from out audiences. These days, about a third of the people who come and see us are from a younger generation who maybe heard about us from their parents or from an aunt or uncle. Once they see our show, they get their own perspective of what Maze is all about and I&rsquo;m as proud of that as I am of anything I&rsquo;ve done just having these young people respond to our music.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Audiences the world over have been responding to the music of Frankie Beverly and Maze since 1977 when the group released the first of a string of non-stop gold albums, the self-titled Maze Featuring Frankie Beverly set. Frankie had made the move from Philly to the Bay Area a few years earlier with original Maze members Roame and McKinley &lsquo;Bug&rsquo; Williams and after opening on tour for the late great Marvin Gaye, the group began an incredible journey that has included gold albums such a Golden Time Of Day (1978), Inspiration (1979), Joy and Pain (1980), Live In New Orleans (1981), We Are One (1983), Can&rsquo;t Stop the Love (1985) and Live In Los Angeles (1968), all recorded for Capitol Records. A 1996 best-selling Anthology provided a perfect retrospective, reflecting an amazing decade of international acclaim and recognition for the group.<\/p>\n<p>The hits from those groundbreaking albums earned Maze a permanent place on the charts with twenty-four R&amp;B Top 40 singles from 1977 to 1994 including such popular anthems as &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m Alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Golden Time Of Day,&rdquo; &ldquo;Southern Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;Runnin&rsquo; Away,&rdquo; &ldquo;Before I Let Go,:&rdquo; &ldquo;Back In Stride,&rdquo; &ldquo;Too Many Games,&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get Over You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Silky Soul,&rdquo; the latter two recorded for Warner Brothers after the group signed with the label in 1989. The change in record labels ushered in a new era for Frankie &amp; Maze. &ldquo;We wanted to emphasize our strengths, bring together the elements that have always been a part of our music and really focus on them,&rdquo; notes Frankie. What followed were two more chartmaking gold albums &ndash; 1989&rsquo;s &ldquo;Silky Soul&rdquo; and 1993&rsquo;s &ldquo;Back To Basics&rdquo; (which featured the hits, &ldquo;Laid Back Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Morning After&rdquo; and &ldquo;What Goes Up&rdquo;) and as always, the band continued touring both in North America and Europe, performing before standing-room-only venues everywhere. Any Maze concert always included must-do tunes like &ldquo;Happy Feelings,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Are One,&rdquo; &ldquo;Before I Let Go,&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Get Over You,&rdquo; &ldquo;While I&rsquo;m Alone&rdquo; and the ultimate crowd-pleaser &ldquo;Joy And Pain&rdquo; which always finds audiences up on their feet, dancing and singing along. Says Frankie, &ldquo;Those songs are still so big for us and the people respond now more than they ever have!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A new decade finds Frankie revamping the line-up for the band which now includes Mike White on drums, Larry Kimpel on bass, Jubu Smith on guitar, Carl Wheeler on keyboards and Vance Taylor on keyboards along with original members Roame on congas and background vocals and McKinley &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; Williams on percussion and background vocals. &ldquo;Having the new band is allowing me to do some musical things I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do, to step out there musically,&rdquo; says Frankie. &ldquo;Our audiences are not going to miss the way Maze sounds but they are going to get something adventurous from us&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That new spirit of adventure and exploration is also seeping into the work Frankie is doing on a new album. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working in the studio but I&rsquo;m not in a hurry to finish,&rdquo; says the multi-talented Mr. Beverly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking my time because the more life I live, the more experiences I have to put into the music. I&rsquo;m also looking for the right recording situation for us and we&rsquo;re so lucky because even though we haven&rsquo;t had a new album in several years, our audiences are still knocking the doors down.&rdquo; In 2004, the band played at the annual Essence Music Festival for the tenth year and says Frankie, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what time we go on, the crowd is there, waiting on us! We&rsquo;ve been on an amazing run and it&rsquo;s taught me something: the record business is not the music business. When you have the kind of commitment to our art as musicians that we have, you get more than you could ever imagine or expect.<\/p>\n<p>Frankie&rsquo;s own musical goals include completing a long-awaited Christmas Album, shows in Africa and concerts of Maze music with a full symphonic orchestra. There&rsquo;s no doubt that whatever new opportunities Frankie and Maze as they move towards their fourth decade in music, audiences everywhere will be as responsible as ever: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so grateful for the way the people continue to support us,&rdquo; says Frankie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it this far because we love and respect ourselves and our fans. But, most importantly, we believe in what we do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MazefeaturingFrankieBeverly_3_40_44_PM_10_27_2017.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 29 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 29","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3DvdryKH4O95ZnsUZJKXpt"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mazemuze?lang=en"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.mazemuze.com\/flash\/Renaissance\/index2.html"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:28 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"cheat-codes":{"id":"3833","name":"Cheat Codes","friendly_url":"cheat-codes","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Cheat Codes isn&rsquo;t just the musical union of Trevor Dahl, Matthew Russell, and Kevin Ford, it&rsquo;s also a mantra. The members of the electronic dance music outfit may have arguably figured out the secret to life&mdash;or at least a way to jump right to the good part&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Cheat Code to Life&rsquo; is being able to have fun, while skipping all of the hard stuff and any sorts of limitations,&rsquo;&rdquo; explains Matthew. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our mission statement. The whole idea and vision for us was to start a project that was really entertaining and fun. We decided if we made simple quality songs, it would work out organically.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We all believe in the &lsquo;Law of Attraction,&rsquo;&rdquo; Trevor elaborates. &ldquo;If you focus only on what you want to do, you can bring it to life, leaping over all of the difficulties.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That focus continues to yield incredible results for the Los Angeles-based trio. The three friends decided to start making music in 2014. Their first independent single, 2015&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adventure,&rdquo; clinched #1 on Spotify&rsquo;s Global Viral 50 and earned over 5 million-plus plays in a year. Shortly after, the boys hit the road with The Chainsmokers, Ansolo, and DallasK on a sold out U.S. tour, garnering support from the likes of Diplo, Like Mike &amp; Dimitri Vegas, and more. Along the way, they received props and coverage from <em>BuzzFeed<\/em>, <em>Huffington Post<\/em>, <em>Indie Shuffle<\/em>, <em>EDM Sauce<\/em>, and many others.<\/p>\n<p>Everything set the stage for the explosion of their next smash &ldquo;Sex&rdquo; with Kriss Kross Amsterdam. Within two months of its release, the song vaulted to #10 on Spotify&rsquo;s Global Charts, went Top 20 in 20 countries, and racked up 100 million-plus streams and 10-million YouTube views and counting.<\/p>\n<p>Taking the hook from Salt-N-Pepa&rsquo;s timeless nineties jam &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk About Sex&rdquo; and bumping and grinding it against a tropical-inspired house soundscape dripping with cheeky club energy, &ldquo;Sex&rdquo; immediately seduces anyone in earshot.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were just writing together one night,&rdquo; recalls Trevor. &ldquo;Matt started humming the chorus. Within an hour, we had the first verse. It was recorded at our home studio, and we just wanted to do our own thing. It felt right!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it goes for everything,&rdquo; adds Kevin. &ldquo;When it came time to make a visual, we didn&rsquo;t want to do something typical either. We wanted to shoot something funny and unique with the Sex Ed class.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who knows if we&rsquo;d ever get the chance to do that again,&rdquo; grins Matthew.<\/p>\n<p>Cheat Codes continue to prove their philosophy right, and &ldquo;Sex&rdquo; is just the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, we just want to write good music,&rdquo; concludes Trevor. &ldquo;It can be crazy. It can be sad. It can be happy. It&rsquo;s just got to reflect who we are.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When people hear us, I want them to feel like they can enjoy life and have a good time,&rdquo; Matthew leaves off. &ldquo;Life is meant to be easy. We&rsquo;re proof. You can create whatever vision you have. It can be as crazy as, &lsquo;I want to make songs about sex and turn it into a job!&rsquo; You can literally do anything.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CheatCodes_11_12_09_AM_3_22_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 4 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 4","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cheatcodesmusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cheatcodes"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7DMveApC7UnC2NPfPvlHSU"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CheatCodesMusic"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.cheatcodesmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChCWmgEgUXwS5QEZZ-iWN-Q"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:22 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chromeo":{"id":"3722","name":"Chromeo","friendly_url":"chromeo","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>World leaders, powerful CEOs, and other fat cats could learn a lesson or two from electrofunk duo Chromeo, namely: know thyself, know thy vibe, and stay thy course.

The mission, the package, the vision &mdash; it&rsquo;s been a straight shot of pure intentionality from the jump.

Touring across the US, Australia, Middle East, Europe and in his hometown of St. Louis with Taylor Swift, have been just a few highlights for the year.<\/p>\n<p>Nelly is a multi-platinum, Grammy Award-winning rap superstar, entrepreneur, philanthropist and actor, who has continually raised the bar for the entertainment industry since stepping on the scene in 2000 with his chart topping album, <em>Country Grammar<\/em>.&nbsp;<em>Country Grammar <\/em>spent seven weeks at #1 on the <em>Billboard Top 200<\/em> and spawned the massive hits &ldquo;Ride Wit Me&rdquo;, &ldquo;Country Grammar&rdquo;, and &ldquo;E.I.&rdquo;.&nbsp; The album landed Nelly four Grammy Award nominations and sold over nine million copies worldwide.&nbsp; Nelly kept the momentum going with the 2002 release of <em>Nellyville<\/em>.&nbsp; The album debuted at #1 on top of scoring Nelly his first two Grammy Awards for &ldquo;Hot in Here&rdquo; &ndash; <em>Best Male Rap Solo Performance<\/em> &ndash; and &ldquo;Dilemma&rdquo; [feat.

Nelly partnered with Vatterott College to create Ex&rsquo;treme Institute (EI), a college tailored to educating those interested in the music industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In&nbsp;2005, Nelly made his big screen debut in the Adam Sandler and Chris Rock hit remake, <em>The Longest Yard<\/em>.

An athlete all his life, Young possesses a keen look in his eyes &ndash; an intensity &ndash; akin to a pitcher out on the mound, on any team, from a nine-year-old kid in the Babe Ruth league all the way up to a million dollar ace in the majors. It&rsquo;s a sure fit for the singer\/songwriter who sidestepped a Major League Baseball fast track to focus on his budding creativity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Young&rsquo;s soulful vocals and impassioned lyrics are derived from the self-discipline learned form years on the baseball field. When it comes to Brett Young, it isn&rsquo;t so far from a pitcher&rsquo;s mound to a performer&rsquo;s stage, and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what kind of Big Show you&rsquo;re talking about. One pass through the California native&rsquo;s current sample of songs proves he is in love with love.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everyone leaves a trail of &lsquo;almosts&rsquo; and bittersweet memories behind on the road to &lsquo;the one&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Brett. &ldquo;It happened to me on my journey&mdash;it happens to everyone. Now I use those moments when I write music. I guess it is fortunate for me that people most easily relate to heartbreak. I&rsquo;m an over- emotional, hopeless romantic who feels everything, and that shows in my songs.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A sentimental dreamer, Young makes love look like an art form with songs like &ldquo;Left Side of Leaving,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sleep Without You&rdquo; and &rdquo;You Ain&rsquo;t Here to Kiss Me.&rdquo; His blue-eyed gaze pierces through the audience, understanding each person&rsquo;s point of view and displaying an unnerving vulnerability as he introduces his music throughout Nashville.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I grew up with Marvin Gaye, Kenny Rodgers, Tim McGraw&mdash; emotionally expressive singers. I like that the emotion carries the songs, where the music is almost secondary,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Van Morrison&rsquo;s &lsquo;Crazy Love&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s just timeless. They influence me; as a songwriter and a performer, I want to connect like they did. And when your audience feels like they can relate, then you have something much more special than a show, or a sale. You have a connection&hellip;you truly have a fan.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>His Republic Nashville introduction follows a string of previously released recordings that gathered a cult following encompassed in &ldquo;Caliville&rdquo; &ndash; the world between Young&rsquo;s SoCal roots and Music City coming-of-age. Young&rsquo;s songwriting credits are extensive, having his music appear on shows like <em>Chrisley Knows Best <\/em>(USA), <em>Real World <\/em>(MTV) and <em>Kourtney and Kim Take New York <\/em>(E!). Now in the studio with GRAMMY and CMA Award winning producer Dann Huff, Young is charming his way track by track with an eclectic mix sure to carve a path in 2016.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BrettYoung_2_22_24_PM_2_13_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/brettyoungmusicpage\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/brettyoungmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/album\/6MTPPsqX8KnmDWmnQmbxJ5"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrettYoungMusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/brettyoungmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChpgnPWp9RsKODOmExta_TA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:42 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"benjamin-booker":{"id":"3837","name":"Benjamin Booker","friendly_url":"benjamin-booker","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p><strong>Benjamin Booker<\/strong>&nbsp;is an American musician, singer, songwriter and guitarist.

They loved it all: the twang of folk, the beat of hip-hop, the drive of rock &amp; roll, the punch of pop. Later, after college brought the musicians to Tennessee, it only made sense to combine those different backgrounds &mdash; and different sounds &mdash; together.<\/p>\n<p>With their second full-length album <em>Folk Hop N Roll<\/em>, the guys shine a light on the place where their influences overlap. It's a wide-ranging sound, with fuzz bass, hip-hop percussion, distorted banjo riffs, and super-sized melodies all stirred into the same mixing pot.<\/p>\n<p>\"There's no boundaries,\" says front man Judah Akers, who shares the band's lineup with mandolin player Brian Macdonald and banjo wiz Nate Zuercher. \"We wanted to make something raw, something with attitude. We all grew up loving these hip-hop beats, so why not make an album that has the grit of Run DMC or Beastie Boys, along with all the folk instruments that we play?\"<\/p>\n<p>Like <em>Kids These Days <\/em>&mdash; the band's debut record, which climbed to number four on the <em>Billboard <\/em>Folk Chart and number two on the genre-wide Heatseekers chart after its release in September 2014 &mdash; <em>Folk Hop N Roll <\/em>was produced by award winner Dave Cobb (Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, Chris Stapleton). Cobb captured the band's new songs in a series of quick, inspired takes, aiming for performances that sounded real and raw rather than polished and perfect. Everything was done in just two weeks. The goal was to fuel the album with the same electricity that fills the band's live show.<\/p>\n<p>An independent band whose success has arrived not on the back of some big budget major label, but through the band's own touring, Judah &amp; the Lion have built a large, loyal fanbase on the road. They played 150 shows in 2015 alone, stretching their gigs all across America and Scandinavia. Along the way, they shared stages with artists like Mat Kearney, Drew Holcomb, and Ben Rector. That sort of drive &mdash; the commitment to chasing down their dreams, one encore at a time &mdash; also fuels the lyrics that appear on <em>Folk Hop N Roll<\/em>, a record whose songs spin stories of struggle, triumph, and all points in between.<\/p>\n<p>\"This record was made for the live show,\" Akers promises. \"Our shows are all about the experience we share with our fans. We know that people work everyday jobs or go to school, and they're dealing with life, and yet they're still choosing to spend the night with us. We don't take that lightly. We give them an experience. We throw an absolute rage. And all the songs were made with that in mind. They're fun, carefree, and youthful, and we live our lives that way, too.\"<\/p>\n<p>Anthemic and wildly creative, <em>Folk Hop N Roll <\/em>is unlike anything else in modern music. It's a rule- breaking record, with Judah &amp; the Lion creating a sound that belongs entirely to them. From the earthy stomp of roots music to the bold bounce of hip-hop, <em>Folk Hop N Roll <\/em>casts a wide net, proof that Judah &amp; the Lion &mdash; who are now four releases into their career &mdash; have developed quite the roar.<\/p>\n<p>Judah &amp; the Lion followed the release of <em>Folk Hop N Roll <\/em>with a massive tour spanning most of 2016. Late in the year, after being named iHeartRadio&rsquo;s Artist on the Verge, their single &ldquo;Take It All Back&rdquo; began to climb the ranks at Alternative Radio, eventually culminating in a three week stint in the #1 spot to kick off 2017. In tandem with their first #1 song, Judah &amp; the Lion also kicked off a tour as support for Twenty One Pilots which brought them to arenas all across the US.<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by how their genre-blending style was connecting with fans, Judah &amp; the Lion headed back into the studio in early 2017 to record 4 brand new songs dubbed the Going to Mars Collection, which, when combined with <em>Folk Hop N Roll, <\/em>make up <em>Folk Hop N Roll Deluxe. <\/em>In support of the Deluxe Edition, the band embarked on The Going to Mars Tour throughout much of 2017 and beyond&ndash; taking them on their biggest headlining run to date. In between, they hit the road for select dates with Kaleo and hit amphitheaters this summer with Jimmy Eat World and Incubus.<\/p>\n<p>The rebooted version of the album includes the band&rsquo;s follow up to &ldquo;Take It All Back,&rdquo; the equally high energy and anthemic &ldquo;Suit and Jacket&rdquo; which debuted on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live! <\/em>in September and hit Top 5 at Alternative Radio. With no intention of slowing down anytime soon, Judah &amp; the Lion is set to embark on yet another massive headlining run in 2018 with their new single &ldquo;Going to Mars&rdquo; hitting airwaves soon.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JudahTheLion_1_44_40_PM_3_22_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/judahandthelion"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/judahandthelion\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3wWtfT7S2uVJJ3hGZlOLkZ"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/judahandthelion"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.judahandthelion.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC46vPb56lPxuyu5fxyvU7FQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:16 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"victor-manuelle":{"id":"3978","name":"Victor Manuelle","friendly_url":"victor-manuelle","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p><font>The acclaimed singer, author and Puerto Rican producer&nbsp;<\/font>V&Iacute;CTOR MANUELLE<font>&nbsp;began his professional career in 1993, and to date has sold millions of records worldwide.&nbsp;In the United States and Puerto Rico, four of their albums have achieved sales in the Multi-Platinum certification by RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America&reg;), in addition to six Platinum albums and eight Gold.

That familiar snarl of a slide guitar rips open the room, and you know you&rsquo;re about to experience a bad-to-the-bone icon at his very best. <strong>George Thorogood And The Destroyers<\/strong> are throwing a <strong>Rock Party<\/strong> for 2018, and you&rsquo;re invited.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; Thorogood says with a laugh, &ldquo;it all started with a birthday party.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For any kid growing up in the &lsquo;60s, the first sightings of live rock &amp; roll on TV were mind-bendingly seismic. &ldquo;Ask Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp or Chrissie Hynde, and they&rsquo;ll tell you the same thing,&rdquo; George says. &ldquo;The Beatles on <em>The Ed Sullivan Show <\/em>and The Rolling Stones on <em>Shindig<\/em> -- we all saw that and said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s what I want to do.&rsquo;&rdquo; Almost immediately, teens across America, including the suburbs of Wilmington, Delaware, started to put together bands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know how to play guitar then, but the band up the street needed a singer,&rdquo; he remembers. &ldquo;And because I knew the words to a bunch of songs, I said I&rsquo;d give it a try. The first show we ever played was a party for my twin sisters&rsquo; birthday. I was 15 years old and got paid $20. That was the day I became a professional rock performer.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>By his early 20s, Thorogood was a solo acoustic player in the Robert Johnson\/Elmore James vein. &ldquo;As long as someone was listening, I knew things could fall into place,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I started doing pretty good for a solo act. I wasn&rsquo;t making a fortune, but I was opening for people like Hound Dog Taylor and Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee. I was getting a lot of positive feedback from some very heavy blues people, and all of them advised to put together a band.&rdquo; George called high-school pal and drummer Jeff Simon, and with the addition of a second guitar player &ndash; a trio modeled after Hound Dog Taylor&rsquo;s HouseRockers &ndash; the now electric three-piece piled into Jeff&rsquo;s Chevy van and headed north. &ldquo;Boston was where the action was,&rdquo; Thorogood explains. &ldquo;We hooked up with a decent booking agent and started playing gigs throughout New England and the Delaware Valley. I knew that if we just kept playing, our sound would come out naturally. And it did. Audiences loved us. The acts we were opening for, like Muddy Waters and Howlin&rsquo; Wolf, loved us. We were playing great, but we couldn&rsquo;t earn more than $200 a night.&rdquo; Through it all, the big brass ring remained a record deal. &ldquo;We made demo tapes and sent them around. Every major label passed. Then in 1976, a guy saw us playing in a bar in Boston who knew someone at a folk label called Rounder Records. Oddly enough, they were in Cambridge. I&rsquo;d never heard of them, and they were my last shot.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d released a few blues records, mainly field recordings, but George was as electrifying on stage back then as he is now,&rdquo; says Rounder Music Group Vice President of A&amp;R Scott Billington. &ldquo;It was the same time that punk rock was becoming popular, and it was the right time for someone to come along with a true back-to-basics approach. George was so passionate about the music he played and the musicians he respected so much, whether it was John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Reed or Hank Williams. Like the British Invasion before, he brought these songs to new audiences and made them come alive in a whole new way.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>George Thorogood And The Destroyers&rsquo; self-titled and now-classic debut on Rounder would soon be certified Gold. Over the course of 16 studio albums &ndash; including six Gold and two Platinum discs on Rounder, EMI and Capitol &ndash; the band would amass an unmatched catalog of hits that includes &ldquo;Who Do You Love&rdquo;, &ldquo;I Drink Alone&rdquo;, &ldquo;One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Move It On Over&rdquo;, &ldquo;Get A Haircut&rdquo; and the ultimate badass anthem, &ldquo;Bad To The Bone.&rdquo; But it was their powerhouse live performances that made GT&amp;D legendary: from unforgettable appearances on <em>SNL<\/em> and Live Aid, to the opening slot on the Rolling Stones&rsquo; historic &rsquo;81 tour, to their own record-breaking 50\/50 tour, to this year&rsquo;s 40<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of their first Canadian shows, George and his longtime band &ndash; Jeff Simon (drums, percussion), Bill Blough (bass guitar), Jim Suhler (rhythm guitar) and Buddy Leach (saxophone) &ndash; remain among the most relentless and relevant classic rock acts on tour today. &ldquo;In 1975, there was no such thing as classic rock radio, MTV or House of Blues, and casinos weren&rsquo;t hiring rock acts,&rdquo; George explains. &ldquo;There have been so many great avenues of expression created since then that have made a huge difference in the way all of us experience live music. We&rsquo;re fortunate to have the kind of material that could utilize all of these formats without having to change our sound or attitude.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>From coast to coast, the critics agree: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say, after all these years, that George is still &lsquo;Bad To The Bone&rsquo; and he&rsquo;s never let go of the true spirit of rock &rsquo;n roll!\" says the <strong><em>L.A. Daily News<\/em><\/strong>; &ldquo;Thorogood is a guitar-blazing revivalist whose enthusiasm and showmanship make the music fresh,&rdquo; says the <strong><em>Baltimore Sun<\/em><\/strong>; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got charisma and personality to burn, a fact that becomes evident the moment he walks on stage,&rdquo; says the <strong><em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>And in a landmark year that&rsquo;s also seen the acclaimed release of George&rsquo;s first-ever solo album, <em>Party Of One<\/em> on Rounder Records, the new Thorogood\/Destroyers tour promises to raise the bar, rock the house and tear off the roof like never before. &ldquo;We play for a different audience every night and that keeps it fresh,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are people who&rsquo;ve never seen us before, and we have to impress them. There are fans that keep coming back, and we want to surprise them.&rdquo; More than 40 years, 15 million albums sold and 8,000 live shows after it all began, the title &lsquo;professional rock performer&rsquo; still means something to the man and his music. &ldquo;This is my job,&rdquo; Thorogood says with pride. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved it, and I love it now more than ever.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>From a birthday party in Wilmington to concert stages around the world, it&rsquo;s been one of the most credible and uncompromising rides in American music. Today, one badder-than-ever guitar-slinger and his band are back to play like they still have something to prove.

His sophomore album How Do You Do earned him a Grammy nod. And if he got a vote for every SoundCloud follower he has (five million), he could get elected Senator somewhere. But he&rsquo;s not some piece of shit politician; he&rsquo;s a musician who writes songs from the soul.<\/p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some stuff you can&rsquo;t find on Wikipedia: Mayer Hawthorne starts his day off with waffles and The Whispers or turkey sausage and Steely Dan. Sometimes it&rsquo;s punk rock and pancakes for dinner. It doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as it&rsquo;s breakfast food and music.<\/p>\n<p>Raised by hippie parents in Ann Arbor, Michigan, smack between the Hash Bash and the car factories &ndash; Hawthorne&rsquo;s old man taught him to play bass guitar at age five. He would play records in the house all while Mayer was growing up. He put him up on game. He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;You hear him singing there? That&rsquo;s David Ruffin.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;You hear that guitar solo? That&rsquo;s Stephen Stills.&rdquo; And young Hawthorne would sit there, with his bowl of cereal, soaking it up.<\/p>\n<p>Mayer DJed in Michigan at the height of Detroit hip-hop. He was there. Before Em blew, when Dilla was still alive. He was spinning records and making rap beats. Now he&rsquo;s making soul records and rappers are sampling him. Circle of life.<\/p>\n<p>Mayer&rsquo;s been digging in the crates and you can hear the influences in his music. A touch of Shuggie Otis here, some Bob Marley there, a sprinkle of Sly Stone&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>On his fourth full-length album, due out this spring, Hawthorne is back to handling the lion&rsquo;s share of production. He also played damn near every instrument on the album and penned every track. His songwriting pulls from his life and observations; his heartache and joy. Sometimes it&rsquo;s groovy, other times he&rsquo;s vulnerable and sincere.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s the shit people listen to when they wanna get drunk and stoned and sentimental. The reason? Mayer Hawthorne stays making that timeless, soulful, baby-making music.<\/p>\n<p>-Jude Angelini<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MayerHawthorne_5_11_PM_5_16_2016.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 7 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 7","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MayerHawthorne"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.mayerhawthorne.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayerhawthorne"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/MayerHawthorne"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mayerhawthorne\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4d53BMrRlQkrQMz5d59f2O"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:56 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"trace-adkins":{"id":"3814","name":"Trace Adkins","friendly_url":"trace-adkins","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p>Trace Adkins&rsquo; trademark baritone has powered countless hits to the top of the charts.

Let Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson explain.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It should make you want to drive fast, ****, and dance,&rdquo; he grins.<\/p>\n<p>On their seventh full-length album,&nbsp;<em>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll <\/em>[F-Bomb Records\/Caroline], the Los Angeles quintet&mdash;Josh Todd [vocals], Nelson, Stevie D. [guitar], Xavier Muriel [drums], and Kelly LeMieux [bass]&mdash;staunchly uphold the commandments of rock music with an arsenal of new anthems primed to explode on impact and teeming with riotous energy, sexy swagger, and primal chops intact. It&rsquo;s something that the boys have done since day one, but it&rsquo;s more necessary now than ever.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been so much talk about how rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll is dead and all of this bullshit,&rdquo; sighs Todd. &ldquo;The funny thing is, that&rsquo;s been going on since we put out our first record in 1999. We wanted to call the new album <em>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll<\/em>, because this is what we&rsquo;ve been doing our whole lives. We focused on making a record that encompasses all of what we are. You get every flavor of Buckcherry.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>2014 saw the group unleash their ****&nbsp;EP, the first release for their own F-Bomb Records. Bolstered by the hit single &ldquo;Say **** It,&rdquo; a sizzling take on Icona Pop&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Love It,&rdquo; the six-song set quickly became a commercial and critical success. Immediately after it impacted, they cut the ten tracks that would comprise <em>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll<\/em>, once again produced by Keith Nelson.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the best time to be in Buckcherry,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got our own record label, and we&rsquo;re making all the rules. We had so much fun on the ****&nbsp;EP, and it gave us a foundation as far as putting out an album independently. The momentum was so great that we didn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They rev up <em>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll<\/em> with the propulsive first single and opener &ldquo;Bring It On Back.&rdquo; From the jump, a robust guitar groove struts right alongside an unshakable refrain. It&rsquo;s got the band&rsquo;s signature hallmarks, but Todd pulled lyrical inspiration from a new source altogether. &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m not on the road, I race Go Karts for my hobby,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The song is really about racing. I had a driver named Kurt Busch in mind when I wrote the lyrics. They call him &lsquo;The Outlaw,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;s a badass. It captures that intensity of racing and the mentality. I love it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Then, there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tight Pants,&rdquo; which continues a tradition of seductively slithering rockers, while embracing a funk charisma, boisterous horns, and a swing that would make James Brown proud. &ldquo;We worked on that the most,&rdquo; recalls Nelson. &ldquo;I really pushed to try the horns, and we ended up with this catchy arrangement. That&rsquo;s ballsy for a rock band to do.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quintessential Buckcherry,&rdquo; exclaims Todd. &ldquo;We love women. They&rsquo;re a great subject, so that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s about.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the hyper hop of &ldquo;The Madness&rdquo; details &ldquo;struggling with urges and loving things that are bad for you,&rdquo; while the soaring ballad &ldquo;The Feeling Never Dies&rdquo; gave a the frontman an opportunity to collaborate with someone he&rsquo;d always wanted to&mdash;daughter.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wrote it to have a song in the house that I could sing with my little girl,&rdquo; he smiles. &ldquo;We would just sing it together at the piano. On a whim, I showed it to Keith, and he loved it. We really rounded it out so it&rsquo;s got this big epic feel.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Buckcherry have added fuel to the genre&rsquo;s fire for nearly two decades now. The Grammy Award-nominated multi-platinum outfit is responsible for smashes including &ldquo;Lit Up&rdquo; off their gold-certified 1999 self-titled debut as well as &ldquo;Crazy Bitch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; from 2006&rsquo;s platinum <em>15<\/em>. Along the way, they&rsquo;ve shared stages with everybody from AC\/DC and <em>M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e<\/em><em> to Slipknot and Rob Zombie as well as festival bills including <\/em><em>Bamboozle<\/em><em> with Bon Jovi and <\/em><em>In-N-Iron<\/em><em>, <\/em><em>Sturgis<\/em><em>, and more.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Ultimately, with Buckcherry at the wheel, <\/em><em>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; Roll<\/em><em> is in good hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been about having a good time,&rdquo; concludes Nelson. &ldquo;You tune the noise out of your life for 40 minutes and enjoy yourself. That&rsquo;s why we started doing this in the first place.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Todd agrees, &ldquo;Buckcherry fills a void. There aren&rsquo;t any other records like this in the genre. I hope it can capture a certain time for people. That&rsquo;s the goal.&rdquo; &mdash; <\/em><em>Rick Florino<\/em><em>, April 2015<\/em><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Buckcherry_11_13_19_AM_3_30_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 28 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 28","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/buckcherry"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/buckcherry\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0yN7xI1blow9nYIK0R8nM7"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/buckcherry"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/buckcherry.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BuckcherryOfficial"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/03\/2018 02:26:30 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"pod":{"id":"3974","name":"P.O.D.","friendly_url":"pod","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>P.O.D.

At the time, Simonett had lost most of his music gear, thanks to a&nbsp; group of enterprising car thieves who'd ransacked his vehicle while he played a show with his previous band. Left with nothing more than an acoustic guitar, he began piecing together a new band, this time taking inspiration from bluegrass, folk, and other genres that didn't rely on amplification. Simonett hadn't played any bluegrass music before, and he filled his lineup with other newcomers to the genre, including fiddler Ryan Young (who'd previously played drums in a speed metal act) and bassist Tim Saxhaug. Along with mandolinist Erik Berry and banjo player Dave Carroll, the group began carving out a fast, frenetic sound that owed as much to rock &amp; roll as bluegrass.<\/p>\n<p>Trampled by Turtles released their first record,&nbsp;<em>Songs from a Ghost Town<\/em>, in 2004. In a genre steeped in tradition, the album stood out for its contemporary sound, essentially bridging the gap between the bandmates' background in rock music and their new acoustic leanings.&nbsp;<em>Blue Sky and the Devil&nbsp;<\/em>(2005) and&nbsp;<em>Trouble<\/em>&nbsp;(2007) explored a similar sound, but it wasn't until 2008 and the band's fourth release,&nbsp;<em>Duluth<\/em>, that Trampled by Turtles received recognition by the bluegrass community. Duluth peaked at number eight on the Billboard bluegrass chart and paved the way for a number of festival appearances. When&nbsp;<em>Palomino<\/em>&nbsp;arrived in 2010, it was met with an even greater response, debuting at the top of the bluegrass chart and remaining in the Top Ten for more than a year. Two years later, their crossover appeal landed them at number 32 on the Billboard 200 pop charts upon the release of their sixth album,&nbsp;<em>Stars and Satellites<\/em>. In addition to major bluegrass and folk festivals, they began showing up at Coachella, Bumbershoot, and Lollapalooza. The official concert album,&nbsp;<em>Live at First Avenue<\/em>, followed in 2013, recorded at Minnesota's most famous venue. A year later, the band returned with the darker-toned&nbsp;<em>Wild Animals<\/em>, which bettered its studio predecessor on the album charts, reaching number 29. Trampled will&nbsp; release their latest album<em>&nbsp;Life Is Good On The Open Road<\/em>&nbsp;on May 4th, 2018.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TrampledByTurtles_1_44_46_PM_2_23_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 5 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 5","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TrampledByTurtles"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/trampledbyturtles.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tbtduluth"},{"type":"youtube","link":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ejfMrZQU3Eo&ob=av2e"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tbtduluth\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3GjVVVcFmUgEJEAAsbGkf4"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:16 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"gin-blossoms":{"id":"3858","name":"Gin Blossoms","friendly_url":"gin-blossoms","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 5","description":"<p>The Gin Blossoms have undoubtedly left their mark on the Rock music map.

After being nominated for a handful of GRAMMY Awards, snagging a collection of CMA&rsquo;s and touring the world behind a pair of critically-acclaimed albums, it would be far too easy for the revered singer-songwriter and top-notch musician to rest on his laurels. But Hayes wants more. &ldquo;I had to get in the mindset of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m starting over,&rsquo;&rdquo; the 25-year-old says boldly of a rigorous two-year process during which he wrote more than 100 songs; made a Nashville studio his personal playground and, most important for his development as a category-defying artist and musical innovator, flipped convention on its head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting from scratch,&rdquo; Hayes declares with equal parts excitement and nervous anticipation of the mindset behind cooking up some of the most bold, hook-heavy material of his career with a heavier emphasis on band-based arrangements and live drums. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about who I am and where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The initial returns on Hayes&rsquo; focused pursuit of the bold and new are a trio of songs released direct to fans via his social media: &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Young Blood.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was so good for my soul,&rdquo; the singer says of the no-holds-barred, loose atmosphere of writing, recording and cutting the new tracks with his trusted band. &ldquo;It was all heart and soul and laying it all out on the table.&rdquo; Written with Barry Dean and Martin Johnson and produced with Dann Huff, &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; is a sonically boisterous stunner; a rollicking, breakneck rock jam that, at its lyrical core, is a no-nonsense breakup song -- a kiss-off, Hayes says, that doubles as &ldquo;a joyous celebration&rdquo; of moving on and never looking back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gone and going so fast you&rsquo;ll never catch me!&rsquo;&rdquo; he says of the song&rsquo;s flavor, adding that breakup songs like it, off &ldquo;life-changing&rdquo; albums like Rascal Flatts&rsquo; <em>Me and My Gang, <\/em>Adele&rsquo;s <em>21 <\/em>or John Mayer&rsquo;s <em>Continuum<\/em>, have long been essential to his life.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Amen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Young Blood&rdquo; also mark exciting new territory for the singer. The former finds Hayes embracing his spiritual side without neglecting his big-throated pop melody, and is what the singer describes as &ldquo;a lonely man&rsquo;s prayer.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hoping you&rsquo;ll find someone that completes your image of your future,&rdquo; he says of &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was very personal for me,&rdquo; he adds of a song he and his band road-tested this summer to rapturous reception. &ldquo;It was a lesson in conviction and knowing how I felt about the song and how important it was to me to have it on the record.&rdquo; &ldquo;Young Blood&rdquo; might very well be Hayes&rsquo; most full-throttle guitar assault yet, not to mention his most lyrically mature. The song, written with Solomon and Lauren Olds, details what Hayes calls &ldquo;the spark and firework of a new exciting relationship&rdquo; and finds Hayes embracing his reckless side. &ldquo;It was a different thing for me to write about,&rdquo; he says with laugh. &ldquo;Letting your guard down for the first time when you&rsquo;re so comfortable around somebody. There&rsquo;s no way I would have written about that even a year ago.&rdquo; The song was also entirely self-produced by the musician: &ldquo;That was nerve-racking and scary,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so used to having Dann Huff in the room; I go off on my musical tangents, and I splatter paint all over the canvas musically, and he cleans up the mess. This time I couldn&rsquo;t second-guess myself. It made me pay attention to the only things that mattered: &lsquo;Does this feel good? Yes. Done.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Whereas previous albums like his Double Platinum-certified, self-titled 2011 debut and 2014&rsquo;s <em>Storyline <\/em>were cut in relatively rapid succession, Hayes had the freedom this go- round to explore every musical avenue of his intrigue. Initially moving out to the country and living at his friend&rsquo;s house, he dove headfirst into the writing process. &ldquo;I wanted the space, freedom and the time to make this new music,&rdquo; he says. Soon after, he returned to Nashville and transformed a backyard studio into a funhouse laboratory of his own design: he set up instrumental stations he could hop back and forth between whenever inspiration struck. &ldquo;I felt like a kid that had just been let into a giant toy store,&rdquo; he says of a process he likens to assembling his earliest demos. &ldquo;Every morning I walked in, flipped two switches, hit record and played. I knew there was nothing in my way.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hayes recognizes such increased hands-on creativity and a newfound wizened humility is essential for any top-notch artist. &ldquo;I had to trust the people around me to tell me the truth,&rdquo; he explains of the oft-brutal process of narrowing down his new songs to the most essential fare. &ldquo;You can think your way through a lot of things,&rdquo; Hayes concludes of his recent creative outburst that&rsquo;s just beginning to reveal itself, &ldquo;but the stuff that really comes from the heart is what&rsquo;s distinct.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_HunterHayes_2_17_22_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 7 - 9:45 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 7","start_time":"9:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hunterhayes"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.hunterhayes.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hunterhayes"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/hunterhayes"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hunterhayes\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7H6dkUChT5EoOQtUVMg4cN"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:50 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"boz-scaggs":{"id":"3825","name":"Boz Scaggs","friendly_url":"boz-scaggs","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at a point where I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun with music, more than ever,&rdquo; Boz Scaggs says about his spellbinding new album, <strong>A Fool to Care<\/strong>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m just going wherever I want to go with it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>You can hear that sense of fun, as well as that ability and willingness to wander in any musical direction throughout the album&rsquo;s twelve tracks. The inspirational heart of those songs lies in the sounds of Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma that played such a vital role in shaping Scaggs&rsquo; musical sensibility, but they venture forth boldly from there, ranging from the seductive New Orleans rumble of the title track to the wry social commentary of &ldquo;Hell to Pay&rdquo; and a heartbreakingly wistful interpretation of The Band&rsquo;s &ldquo;Whispering Pines.&rdquo; As he did on his most recent previous album, <strong>Memphis<\/strong> (2013), Scaggs worked with producer Steve Jordan and a telepathic core band consisting of Jordan on drums, Willie Weeks on bass, Ray Parker, Jr. on rhythm guitar and Jim Cox on keyboards. &ldquo;Steve works on a high energy level,&rdquo; Scaggs says of his prized collaborator. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s relaxed and easy, but also very highly charged. His direction is laser-focused, and his playing is intense. It&rsquo;s a whirlwind and he&rsquo;s a strong leader, but it&rsquo;s also lovely and loose and cool. That&rsquo;s all a comfort to me. I&rsquo;ve produced myself and I feel pretty solid in the studio, but it&rsquo;s really nice for me not to have to do anything but help select the material and be free to be a singer and a guitar player.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Fans who have followed Scaggs&rsquo; remarkable career dating back to the late Sixties with the Steve Miller Band; his solo triumphs with such classic albums as <strong>Silk Degrees<\/strong> (1976) and <strong>Middle Man<\/strong> (1980); and the splendid assurance of late-period high points like <strong>Some Change<\/strong> (1994) and <strong>Dig<\/strong> (2001), will instantly recognize Scaggs&rsquo; characteristically deft touch as a singer. He brings a sly drawl to a funky workout like Li&rsquo;l Millet and the Creoles&rsquo; &ldquo;Rich Woman,&rdquo; a conversational intimacy to Bobby Charles&rsquo;s &ldquo;Small Town Talk,&rdquo; and an elegant delicacy to the Impressions&rsquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m So Proud.&rdquo; He easily negotiates the Latin flavoring of &ldquo;Last Tango on 16<sup>th<\/sup> Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Want to See You,&rdquo; both written by San Francisco bluesman (and longtime Scaggs compatriot) Jack Walroth. His soul is effortless and deeply felt, never making a show of itself, but unmistakably evident in every lyric he delivers.<\/p>\n<p>Recording the album over four days at Blackbird Studio in Nashville made possible the participation of such notable guests as guitarist Reggie Young, who lights up a sinuous cover of Al Green&rsquo;s &ldquo;Full of Fire,&rdquo; and steel guitarist Paul Franklin (&ldquo;one of the greatest steel players alive, and one of the greatest ever,&rdquo; in Scaggs&rsquo; estimation), who lifts a gorgeous reading of Richard Hawley&rsquo;s &ldquo;There&rsquo;s A Storm A Comin&rsquo;&rdquo; into the stratosphere. Horns, strings and soulful background vocalists allow the album to render with equal power the bruising groove of Huey &ldquo;Piano&rdquo; Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;High Blood Pressure,&rdquo; the sophisticated Philly Soul of the Spinners&rsquo; &ldquo;Love Don&rsquo;t Love Nobody&rdquo; and the torrid, big-band R&amp;B of &ldquo;Rich Woman.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Two guests, in particular, make definitive contributions to <strong>A Fool to Care<\/strong>. Bonnie Raitt duets sassily with Scaggs on vocals, and adds her characteristically sizzling slide guitar to &ldquo;Hell to Pay,&rdquo; a knowing indictment of corruption on both the personal and political level that Scaggs wrote himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of those songs that writers talk about that just falls out of the sky,&rdquo; Scaggs says. &ldquo;It just appears, and if you don&rsquo;t look it too hard in the eye, it keeps talking to you. We perform it with that little extra twang, but Bonnie really put the touch on it. She brought it home for me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Lucinda Williams closes out the album with Scaggs on &ldquo;Whispering Pines.&rdquo; The two perform the song as a kind of prayer for deliverance, each of their voices yearning for a redemption that alternately seems barely within reach or drifting just out of reach. &ldquo;The Band&rsquo;s original version of &lsquo;Whispering Pines&rsquo; has an exotic quality to it that I&rsquo;m not sure anybody else who&rsquo;s done it has quite tapped into,&rdquo; Scaggs says. &ldquo;The melody is strange, and there are some chord changes that are quite unexpected. But I heard a live version of it that Lucinda did that was very touching. She seemed extremely vulnerable in the way she approached it, and that vulnerability made for an amazing reading of the song. I couldn&rsquo;t resist asking her to join me, and she was way into it. It was very special to me to be able to do that song with her.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>What ultimately communicates about <strong>A Fool to Care<\/strong> is how fully Boz Scaggs inhabits these songs. They seem less like interpretations than realizations, proofs that when you truly make someone else&rsquo;s song your own, you paradoxically restore something essential to it. Scaggs believes that this album and Memphis, its immediate predecessor, might turn out to be the first two parts of a trilogy, a three-album collaboration with producer Steve Jordan and the band of extraordinarily empathetic musicians they love to work with. Let&rsquo;s hope so, but let&rsquo;s also not get ahead of ourselves. <strong>A Fool to Care<\/strong> is here right now, and to overlook its many great pleasures by thinking about more that might come in the future would be foolish and uncaring indeed. &ndash; Anthony DeCurtis<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BozScaggs_12_15_41_AM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 8 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 8","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BozScaggsMusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bozscaggsmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/46njgd2Rq9tZc4ZjeQMgbh"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bozscaggsmusic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.bozscaggs.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"bishop-briggs":{"id":"3823","name":"Bishop Briggs","friendly_url":"bishop-briggs","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p>While those in a Tokyo karaoke bar may not have realized it, they were witnesses to a life-altering experience for four-year-old Bishop Briggs. As she sang her first song in public, Bishop fell instantly in love with performing, and her auspicious debut served not only as an indelible touchpoint, but also the initial indicator of an unmistakable identity.<\/p>\n<p>Born to Scottish parents, raised in Japan and Hong Kong, immersed in American pop-culture, and having attended college in Hollywood, Bishop is a true world citizen. She began writing her own songs at the age of seven, and would perform these unfiltered observations about her life to a captive audience: her family. It is now recognized that this precociousness, coupled with her upbringing, would draw a clear line to who she would become.<\/p>\n<p>During her early years in Los Angeles, Bishop hit the pavement; focused and on a clear mission, she was never too proud to play any venue that would have her, often to crowds smaller than would gather in her childhood living room. While many would have given up, not only was Bishop undeterred, but, through her perseverance, every challenge and obstacle provided her with much of the life experience that comes through in her music. Now fine-tuned as a performer, Bishop is an example of what happens when ability meets determination.<\/p>\n<p>Her voice has grit and heft -- it is lived-in and unafraid -- putting her solidly in the lineage of female vocalists such as Janis Joplin, Florence Welch, Aretha Franklin, and Alabama Shakes' Brittany Howard. Like those who have left a mark before her, Bishop foregoes restraint and defies categorization, forging a path that is uniquely hers. Though she now sings her own songs in larger, crowded venues, Bishop still performs with the abandon and intimacy of someone addressing a handful of people in a small room. Deceptively composed, Bishop is often only a heartbeat away from howling with joy or being paralyzed by tears. The result is beyond inspiring, and promises to be as much of a transcendent experience for the audience as it is for Bishop.<\/p>\n<p>\"Wild Horses\" and \"River\" are singles that present a rising artist who has spent years developing her craft. The emotions are timeless, the sounds are now; \"River\" juxtaposes the heartfelt, idiosyncratic soul of Jack Garratt and Hozier with the brash, brassy production of Yeezus or TNGHT. Composed in bedrooms, and destined for festival tents and arenas, Bishop claims her music comes from a place of sadness, though it might be more accurate to say it comes from a place of substance. While the words themselves are direct and precise, they encompass grand emotions which are deeply personal yet rendered in a way that invites listeners to project and examine their own experiences; isn't that what music is supposed to do?<\/p>\n<p>What unequivocally distinguishes Bishop is there is no duality -- no difference between Bishop the person and Bishop the artist -- they are one in the same. There is no construct or persona, there's just her. Whether it is the defiance of \"Wild Horses\" or the rapture of \"River,\" they are all inspired by what she calls \"the biggest, most toxic and tragic love affair I've ever had\": her lifelong commitment to music.<\/p>\n<p>Bishop is not offering merely a piece of her heart -- she's giving you the whole thing.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BishopBriggs_1_53_25_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 3 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 3","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thatgirlbishop"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thatgirlbishop\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0yb46jwm7gqbZXVXZQ8Z1e"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thatgirlbishop"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/bishopbriggs.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BishopBriggsVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:32 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"anderson-east":{"id":"3958","name":"Anderson East","friendly_url":"anderson-east","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p>Anderson East is the humble type -- the sort of man who chalks up his success to loads of good fortune. But the singer-songwriter has earned his accolades: one of music&rsquo;s most compelling young artists, East is an unflinching and inimitable talent. Best exemplified on his breakout 2015 debut album,&nbsp;<em>Delilah<\/em>, the Alabama-native wields an unwavering and potent, ever-husky voice. And as seen on standout tracks including &ldquo;Satisfy Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Devil In Me,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s able to effortlessly spin tales of tumult and triumph in equal measure. That&rsquo;s of course to say nothing of the brute force with which the man performs &mdash; fiery and forceful, as much a wily preacher as a patient poet, East has become one of music&rsquo;s must-see live act.<\/p>\n<p>Having recently completed a forthcoming new album with producer Dave Cobb at Nashville&rsquo;s famed RCA Studio A, and preparing to release its first single later this summer, East is hitting the road this summer with Chris Stapleton on the singer&rsquo;s &ldquo;All-American Road Show.\" What NPR Music called a \" &hellip;eclectic, fully formed debut album,&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>Delilah<\/em>&nbsp;was East&rsquo;s launching pad.

In the process, via his own sold out headline shows and from serving as support for monumental artists including Sturgill Simpson and Jason Isbell, he&rsquo;s amassed a dedicated, organic fanbase.<\/p>\n<p>And in addition to making his television debut on&nbsp;<em>Late Night with Seth Meyers<\/em>&nbsp;and appearing on Daryl Hall&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Live from Daryl&rsquo;s House<\/em>, East has also lent his talents to several notable projects.

Then two years later, life took another turn skyward when Neil Young decided to make Promise of the Real his touring and studio band. Young has guided the grateful young musicians ever since as they&rsquo;ve backed the legend on tour around the world and on his two most recent albums.<\/p>\n<p>These experiences were undoubtedly invaluable, but none of what has come before will prepare you for the cosmic country soul of Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real, the band&rsquo;s new, self-titled album, a mesmerizing, emotionally genuine, endlessly rewarding work set for release on Fantasy Records. From the epic &ldquo;Set Me Down on a Cloud&rdquo; to the climactic &ldquo;If I Started Over,&rdquo; the album delivers one sublime song and inspired performance after another.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I knew I had a lot of good songs that transcended the cultural boundaries between rock &amp; roll and country,&rdquo; Lukas says of his vision for the album. &ldquo;I wanted to get the songs as pure as they could be. We owe a lot to Neil; we made this record after coming off the road with him for two years. Neil&rsquo;s been mentoring us, and we&rsquo;ve been absorbing that energy, and I think it shows. We got acclimated to a different level of artistic expression. We&rsquo;ve grown.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real, produced by song-shaping specialist John Alagia (numerous Dave Matthews Band LPs, John Mayer&rsquo;s Room for Squares) was recorded at The Village Studios in West Los Angeles. Promise of the Real&rsquo;s six-piece line-up now includes longtime bandmates Tato Melgar (percussion), Anthony LoGerfo (drums) and Corey McCormick (bass, vocals) along with new members Jesse Siebenberg (steel guitars, Farfisa organ, vocals) and Alberto Bof (piano, Wurlitzer, Hammond B3). Stefani &ldquo;Lady Gaga&rdquo; Germanotta (who convincingly plays the role of Bonnie to Lukas&rsquo; Delaney) added her signature vocals to the rousing &ldquo;Carolina&rdquo; and &ldquo;Find Yourself,&rdquo; while Jess Wolfe and Holly Lessig of the Brooklyn-based indie-pop duo Lucius provide backing vocals on five of the 12 tracks, evoking Exile on Main St.&rsquo;s ecstatic, gospel-rooted harmonies.<\/p>\n<p>The band&rsquo;s many influences can be discerned in the opening track, &ldquo;Set Me Down on a Cloud,&rdquo; a soulful country rocker that features Lucius&rsquo; spiritual vocals and an extended solo underscores Lukas&rsquo; tasteful guitar virtuosity.<\/p>\n<p>The lilting, pastoral &ldquo;Just Outside of Austin&rdquo; features a guitar solo from Willie, while Lukas&rsquo; 86-year-old Aunt Bobbi plays piano. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a love letter to Austin, something like Roger Miller or Glen Campbell would write,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Runnin&rsquo; Shine,&rdquo; one of the album&rsquo;s first-person character studies, is written from the perspective of a young moonshiner trying to outsmart the law while hurtling along Appalachian back roads in a souped-up car loaded with homemade booze. &ldquo;Perspective is huge,&rdquo; says Lukas. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re able to put yourself in someone else&rsquo;s shoes and you can relate to them, it&rsquo;s really hard to hate them, even if you don&rsquo;t agree with how they live their life.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Two of the album&rsquo;s most breathtaking songs, &ldquo;Find Yourself&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forget About Georgia,&rdquo; vividly retrace the turbulent final stages and bittersweet aftermath of the same doomed love affair. &ldquo;After the relationship ended, I had to play Ray Charles&rsquo; &ldquo;Georgia on My Mind&rdquo; every night when I was on the road with my dad, which made it literally impossible to forget about her.&rdquo; Introduced by a wistful four-note guitar lick that reoccurs throughout the arrangement, &ldquo;Forget About Georgia&rdquo; unfolds to a &ldquo;Layla&rdquo;-like outpouring of romantic yearning, as the band stretches out behind Lukas&rsquo; emotional guitar soloing. Not surprisingly, it&rsquo;s Young&rsquo;s favorite song on the album.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Inspired by the big ballads of Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, Lukas delivers a full-throttle vocal on the closing track, &ldquo;If I Started Over,&rdquo; at once a cosmic rumination and a rapturous expression of romantic devotion. &ldquo;The song is asking, what if, after we die, we just come back? What if we have to do the same dream again until we learn the right lessons?&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A seasoned veteran at 28, Austin-born Lukas grew up in Maui, while spending much of his time during school breaks in his hometown and on the road with his dad. &ldquo;I had a lot of passions growing up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I played soccer, I was on the swim team, living a Maui lifestyle, surfing and skateboarding. I also loved singing and wrote my first song when I was 11. I became obsessed with guitar, playing eight to 10 hours a day. I knew what I wanted to do from a super-young age, and I made my life about it.&rdquo; He and his brother Micah played in bands together in high school, and they struck up a friendship with Uruguay-born Tato Melgar, a skilled musician then making his living as a landscaper, who taught the brothers the basics of drumming.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, Lukas headed to the mainland to attend L.A.&rsquo;s Loyola Marymount University. A year later, after meeting LoGerfo at a Neil Young concert, he dropped out of school and started a band with LoGerfo, Melgar and original bassist Merlyn Kelly; he named it Promise of the Real, referencing a line in Young&rsquo;s 1973 song &ldquo;Walk On&rdquo;: &ldquo;Sooner or later it all gets real.&rdquo; When McCormick joined two years later on bass, the POTR lineup was set. The band woodshedded; averaging more than 200 shows a year.&nbsp; Drawing on Lukas&rsquo; lineage as well surrogate uncles like Kris Kristofferson, Waylon Jennings, and the classic rock and roll of J.J. Cale, The Band, Clapton era Delaney and Bonnie and of course mentor Neil Young, they began to develop their own distinctive style of American music.<\/p>\n<p>Young befriended the band after checking them out at Farm Aid several years back. &ldquo;Neil got in touch after that, and we started talking by email,&rdquo; Lukas recounts. &ldquo;Eventually, he asked us to record with him. So we recorded The Monsanto Years and played some shows together, and we fell in love with each other musically, one thing led to another and we became Neil&rsquo;s band.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened with us feels similar to the career trajectory of The Band,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;They were already a great band when they started working with Dylan, who lifted them up, which is similar to what Neil&rsquo;s done for us. He&rsquo;s also given people a chance to hear what we&rsquo;re doing and what our own songs have to offer. Then we played the Desert Trip with Neil, along with Paul McCartney, the Stones, the Who and Dylan. That was incredible.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Those two weekends in Indio last October turned out to be extremely fortuitous. &ldquo;We met Lucius at Desert Trip,&rdquo; says Lukas. &ldquo;They were playing with Roger Waters&mdash;and still are. Then they came to the Bridge School Benefit, where we really got to know them. I love Jess and Holly&mdash;they really enhance the record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Bradley Cooper also saw Lukas play at Desert Trip, and right afterward contacted a mutual friend about helping him on the new film he&rsquo;s directing and starring in, a remake of A Star is Born. &ldquo;At first I was just helping him out, and then I started writing with Stefani (Lady Gaga), who&rsquo;s in the movie. We connected and she and I became really close. I got very involved in this film and ended up bringing the band into it as well.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Coming of age in a celebrated musical family, Lukas Nelson learned early on that true originality is hard won, never given. Doubtlessly blessed with a measure of musical ability, it&rsquo;s clear that his natural gifts have been honed by a singular devotion to craft and a deep appreciation for the sacrifice a creative life requires. Elated by the way things have come together so beautifully, Lukas is gratified that POTR have earned this moment and seized the opportunities that have led to this album&mdash;all perfectly capturing what he&rsquo;d heard in his head 18 months earlier.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just amazing how things have flowed,&rdquo; Lukas marvels. &ldquo;It feels divine in a way.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_LukasNelsonThePromiseOfTheReal_12_26_23_AM_2_23_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lukasnelsonofficial"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/lukasnelsonofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5iXYJYmMcjlTFL1qA8UfgY"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lukasnelson"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/lukasnelson.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCY9rflkzkN4n06iIc1P__rw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/04\/2018 02:54:56 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"sugar-hill-gang":{"id":"3806","name":"Sugar Hill Gang","friendly_url":"sugar-hill-gang","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p><strong>&ldquo;The Sugar Hill Gang&rdquo; with Wonder Mike, Master Gee and HenDogg featuring DJ T Dynasty - the Fathers of Hip Hop<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 1979, the Sugarhill Gang crashed through the walls of the urban cities and into the mainstream of society with the first worldwide rap hit, \"Rapper's Delight.\" Two of the original members of this historic group, Wonder Mike (Michael Wright) and Master Gee (Guy O&rsquo;Brien) had teamed up with Henry Jackson (pka Big Bank Hank) to become the now famous Sugarhill Gang.<\/p>\n<p>Sugarhill Gang is believed by many to be the first professional Hip Hop group, because they introduced to the masses (both in the United States and overseas) this unprecedented genre of music. &ldquo;Rapper's Delight&rdquo; eventually sold over 8 million copies, and went on to be <em>the biggest selling rap single of all time. <\/em>Even today, it continues to appeal to audiences of all ages.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the Sugarhill Gang released such hits as &ldquo;Apache,&rdquo; &ldquo;8th Wonder&rdquo; and &ldquo;Living in the Fast Lane.&rdquo; Wonder Mike and Master Gee teamed up with Henry Williams (pka Hendogg) and DJ T.

He has dedicated his life to spreading the joy of music and positivity to millions of people. In 2013 Michael and his wife Sara founded Do It For The Love Foundation to grant live concert music wishes to people living with life-threatening illnesses, children with severe challenges and wounded veterans throughout North America. Franti believes that in granting live concert music wishes, he is helping those in need to feel supported, loved, happy and hopeful.<\/p>\n<p>Franti is a respected yoga practitioner and is the owner and co-founder of Soulshine Bali, a yoga and wellness retreat oasis in Indonesia. Franti is passionate about promoting a holistic and globally conscious lifestyle and organizes pre-concert yoga meetups in communities along his tours.<\/p>\n<p>In creating their ninth studio album SOULROCKER, Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead introduced a new sensibility to their potent hybrid of hip-hop, rock, folk, and reggae: a gracefully arranged take on electronic music that more than fulfills the band&rsquo;s mission of making impassioned music you can dance to. Along with harnessing the Bay Area-based band&rsquo;s dynamic energy for a more powerful impact than ever before, SOULROCKER again showed Franti&rsquo;s singular ability to channel frustration into music that&rsquo;s both thought-provoking and triumphantly hopeful.<\/p>\n<p>Once an outlier in his message of positivity-minded political consciousness, Franti has found that message gaining momentum in the mainstream in recent years, a phenomenon that compelled him to push his artistry even further, stating &ldquo;I feel a deeper sense of purpose in music today<\/p>\n<p>than I ever have in my career. My goal is to make the most inspiring music I possibly can for this intense, crazy and wonderful time we&rsquo;re all living in.&rdquo; He is currently writing and recording his 10th studio album with A-list producers which is due out in 2018.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MichaelFranti_12_25_38_AM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/michaelfranti\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/michaelfranti\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1mHuZMOP8FG5ip4yAb1vrB"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/michaelfranti"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.michaelfranti.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC8zBFZB7CLNMNnLR1WEgMbw?view_as=subscriber"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/29\/2018 04:08:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-soul-rebels":{"id":"3738","name":"The Soul Rebels","friendly_url":"the-soul-rebels","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":"<p>Eight piece brass ensemble THE SOUL REBELS are&nbsp;riding&nbsp;high&nbsp;in&nbsp;2018&nbsp;after debuting on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert<\/em>, touring four continents including Europe, Australia, debuting in China and Japan, selling out shows, backing up and collaborating live with Nas, G-Eazy, Robert Glasper, DMX, Curren$y, Joey Bada$, Talib Kweli, GZA, Pete Rock, Raekwon, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and Marilyn Manson among many others, and opening for Lauryn Hill.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Soul Rebels started with an idea - to expand upon the pop music they loved on the radio and the New Orleans brass tradition they grew up on.

The Grammy Award&reg;-nominated, platinum-certified trailblazing duo&mdash;<strong>Ken Jordan&nbsp;<\/strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Scott Kirkland<\/strong>&mdash;set the stage for the genre-mashing electronic sounds that fuel the current zeitgeist.<\/p>\n<p>Now, their&nbsp;<strong>exclusive<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>limited edition<\/strong>&nbsp;20<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;Anniversary Signature Box Set houses this sonic story. Including vinyl of their five full-length studio albums&mdash;Vegas [1997], Tweekend [2001], Legion of Boom [2004], Divided By Night [2009], and The Crystal Method [2014]&mdash;and an unreleased Rarities collection, it provides a comprehensive glance at their legacy thus far. Most importantly, the process nodded to the group&rsquo;s diehard audience from the beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our fans couldn&rsquo;t get a lot of our old vinyl,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>Ken<\/strong>&nbsp;explains. &ldquo;We would see copies of Vegas going for hundreds of dollars because they were out-of-print. In the last year, we thought, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we do a complete box set of all our studio albums?&rsquo; Up until Tweekend, we did all of our mixes on digital audio tapes or DATs. We have a big collection of these that are numbered chronologically. While searching for the final &ldquo;Raraties,&rdquo; we combed through all of our old DATs. We had forgotten about so many cool tracks and alternate mixes, it was really cool to go back in time.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;People kept asking us for that early vinyl,&rdquo; adds&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something romantic about taking a record out of a sleeve, putting the needle down, walking away, and listening to an album. We love the process of writing an entire album. That&rsquo;s something we want to preserve.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE CRYSTAL METHOD<\/strong>&nbsp;limited the box set to just 1,000 copies in order to provide an unrivaled experience for listeners. They remastered each album and printed on high quality vinyl. Vegas<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>and Tweekend boast their iconic and original out-of-production cover design while the album art for Legion of Boom, Divided By Night, and The Crystal Method are limited editions exclusive to this box set. Each box is numbered and autographed and includes original tour stickers and laminated, autographed All Access passes from the Vegas tour.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Anytime we did a new record, we didn&rsquo;t want to repeat ourselves,&rdquo; says&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>. &ldquo;We wanted to shift things up a little bit. The goal was to sound like us but try different things. We weren&rsquo;t afraid of working with people who were out of our comfort zone and in other genres. We loved the idea of evolving.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That shared vision of evolution hatched in the most unlikely of places.&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Ken<\/strong>&nbsp;had independently started making music on their own during the early nineties. However, a chance encounter in the break room of a supermarket where they both worked would set them on this course.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have no idea why, but&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>&nbsp;brought his drum machine to work,&rdquo; laughs&nbsp;<strong>Ken<\/strong>. &ldquo;Who does that?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There was nothing else to do,&rdquo; answers&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>. &ldquo;Ken happened to walk into the room that day, and it was the strangest thing. Neither of us knew we were working on music. By chance, this fortuitous occasion changed everything.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Their first singles would be released only on vinyl followed by Vegas, which would become certified platinum by the RIAA. In between releasing albums and never-ending tours, the group&rsquo;s demand amplified within the film and television worlds. They delivered the smash &ldquo;(Can&rsquo;t You) Trip Like I Do&rdquo; with Filter&rsquo;s Richard Patrick for the gold-selling&nbsp;<em>Spawn&nbsp;<\/em>soundtrack, wrote the theme song for&nbsp;<em>Bones<\/em>, scored the indie film &ldquo;London&rdquo; and also scored the J.J. Abrams-produced&nbsp;<em>Almost Human&nbsp;<\/em>for Fox. They also scored characters for The&nbsp;<em>League of Legends<\/em>&nbsp;video game, and contributed music to everything from&nbsp;<em>Real Steel<\/em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Fast &amp; Furious 6<\/em>, along the way working with Danny Elfman, Tom Morello, LeAnn Rimes, Scott Weiland, Metric&rsquo;s Emily Haines, LMFAO, and even film star Milla Jovovich. Legion of Boom notched a 2004 Grammy Award nomination for &ldquo;Best Dance\/Electronic Album&rdquo;&mdash;during the category&rsquo;s first year. They also received another Grammy nomination for Divided By Night in 2009, while delivering unforgettable sets on the stages of&nbsp;<em>Electric Daisy Carnival<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Coachella<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Lollapalooza<\/em>, and&nbsp;<em>HFStival<\/em>&nbsp;to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately,&nbsp;<strong>THE CRYSTAL METHOD<\/strong>&nbsp;stand as strong as ever after 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, we like it when people get goosebumps listening to our records,&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>Ken<\/strong>&nbsp;leaves off. &ldquo;We try to make music that invokes not just feelings, but gives you a physical reaction. It&rsquo;s like a good workout. It can be serious, and it can be uplifting. It&rsquo;s the whole spectrum.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;If our music helps listeners get through something, that&rsquo;s the best thing,&rdquo; concludes&nbsp;<strong>Scott<\/strong>. &ldquo;Hopefully, this vinyl collection will bring some smiles, memories, and good times back to those who have found something in our music over the years.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Cheers to the next twenty.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CrystalMethodThe_4_23_22_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thecrystalmethod?ref=ts"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thecrystalmethod\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5eKLa1xyHLq8ERWmT1CRHj"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/crystalmethod"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/thecrystalmethod.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/thecrystalmethod"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/30\/2018 12:34:02 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"high-valley":{"id":"3850","name":"High Valley","friendly_url":"high-valley","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p>Country fans are no strangers to the uncanny musical connection of a family band, but they&rsquo;ve never heard anything like the duo High Valley &ndash; and that&rsquo;s simply because brothers Brad and Curtis Rempel never knew how country was &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to sound.<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in La Crete, Alberta &mdash; more than 2,500 miles from where they now live in Music City &mdash; Brad and Curtis were completely cut off from the world of pop culture throughout their early lives.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that we weren&rsquo;t allowed to have a radio,&rdquo; lead singer and songwriter Brad, explains. &ldquo;We had radios, but you turned them on and heard a lot of static from an AM station 300 miles away. When it was cold enough you could hear the farm report, the price of grain and the occasional old school country song. We finally got FM in our town when I was in 10th grade.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While their upbringing didn't exactly acquaint them with the Billboard 100, it&rsquo;s that insulation that helped cement their musical ideals and love of simple, classic country, allowing High Valley&rsquo;s music to feel simultaneously fresh and timeless. Dear Life, their recently released major label debut on Atlantic\/Warner Music Nashville, is an album that fuses tradition with wide-eyed musical exploration, stays true to their family-first value system and celebrates resilient positivity.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>High Valley learned to become skilled digital citizens, building an avid fan base that is actively involved in selecting the duo&rsquo;s songs through the High Valley app and connecting with each other via social media. As a result, they have amassed more than 43 million song streams worldwide &ndash; including 22 million for first single &ldquo;Make You Mine.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, they are the first country act to broadcast live on Twitch.TV in the United States and their song &ldquo;Young Forever&rdquo; scored placement on EA Sports&rsquo; Madden NFL 17 Soundtrack. The band has been selected for &ldquo;Ones to Watch&rdquo; recognition by Rolling Stone Country, Spotify, Pandora, CMT and Taste of Country. And they&rsquo;ve been profiled on CBS This Morning for their unique and inspiring story and performed on NBC&rsquo;s Today Show.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;You could say it&rsquo;s weird that we come from the upbringing we do and make this kind of music,&rdquo; Curtis admits, &ldquo;but if you analyze Dear Life and the messages on it, you can almost tell that we were brought up the way we were.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the record was called Dear Life,&rdquo; says Brad. &ldquo;Because that song for me was trying to write a journal entry to God and my life and say, &lsquo;I really have loved every mile of this road.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Saying their biggest compliment is when a fan describes their music as &ldquo;old-school and modern&rdquo; at the same time, &ldquo;Make You Mine&rdquo; is an excellent introduction to the rest of Dear Life. For example &ldquo;She&rsquo;s With Me,&rdquo; the newest single from Dear Life, is an anthemic opening track that begins as something ancient and ends ahead of the country curve, also announcing High Valley&rsquo;s desire for their music to be positive and family oriented.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My life is not perfect, but I&rsquo;ve experienced dark things with positive results at the end of it,&rdquo; Brad says. &ldquo;The opening line of the entire record says &lsquo;When the devil&rsquo;s knocking at my door,&rsquo; and I wouldn't say that&rsquo;s a very positive idea, but the conclusion of the whole song is &lsquo;Holy cow, she&rsquo;s been with me through<br \/>the thick and thin,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s been my experience with my wife.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Families are a tough thing in today&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; Curtis agrees. &ldquo;They fall apart all the time, and if we could leave our mark by doing our little part and trying to bring families together, I think that&rsquo;s great.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the title track &ldquo;Dear Life&rdquo; is a foot stomping thank-you letter inspired by watching children grow, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Stop&rdquo; offers steady encouragement to persevere and the hand-in-hand &ldquo;Memory Makin&rsquo;&rdquo; asks the question, &ldquo;Do you believe that there&rsquo;s a meant-to-be?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Roads We&rsquo;ve Never Taken&rdquo; shows their energized and optimistic outlook with plucky, banjo-rolling abandon, while the chanting gang vocals of &ldquo;Young Forever&rdquo; were dreamed up during a family beach trip to Pensacola.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing makes you feel more young than chilling on a beach and throwing a football around in the waves,&rdquo; Brad says with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like &lsquo;Man, if we could freeze this weekend and stay young forever, itwould be perfect.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The Rempel brothers have already scored six Top 10s, three Gold certifications, played to 15,000 seatarenas opening for Shania Twain and earned multiple awards show wins &ndash; including Canadian CMA Group of the Year. And now with their major label debut, a fall tour with Martina McBride and a headlining U.K. trek on the way, it&rsquo;s true that High Valley inhabit a much different world today than the one they were raised in. But some things remain the same, and that is the central theme of one of the album&rsquo;s most powerful tracks, the hard-charging backroad rocker, &ldquo;I Ain&rsquo;t Changin&rsquo;.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That was a very important song for me because of our upbringing,&rdquo; Brad explains. &ldquo;The chorus is like &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t changing the way I talk, I ain&rsquo;t changing the way I pray, I ain&rsquo;t changing my last name.&rsquo; Yeah, I&rsquo;m in a big city now, not in the middle of some field somewhere&hellip;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t change the core of who we are,&rdquo; Curtis jumps in.<\/p>\n<p>Brad continues. &ldquo;I remember coming to Nashville six years ago and thinking about 100 different things that would blow my mind &ndash; and they&rsquo;re all happening. I don&rsquo;t want to wake up one day and say &lsquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m completely different than what I was.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><br \/>If anything, Dear Life is evidence that Brad and Curtis shouldn't worry about losing their way. Their calling is a strong one &ndash; to bring positive and original family-friendly energy back to the country landscape &ndash; and they&rsquo;re following it with passion.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_HighValley_2_56_27_PM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 8 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 8","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/highvalley\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/highvalleyofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5sQqZtsAbXAoAnvA8iN9kN"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HIGHVALLEY"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.highvalleymusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/highvalleymusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:27:39 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"plain-white-ts":{"id":"3859","name":"Plain White T's","friendly_url":"plain-white-ts","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>Plain White T&rsquo;s - composed of Tom Higgenson, Tim Lopez, Dave Trio, De&rsquo;Mar Hamilton and Mike Retondo - kicked off their vibrant career in the Chicago suburbs in 1997, playing a unique blend of pop, punk, and melody-driven rock and roll in basements and clubs across the metro area.<\/p>\n<p>Two decades later, the quintet has become a global success, with thousands of shows, a string of multi-platinum hit singles (&ldquo;Rhythm of Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;1, 2, 3, 4&rdquo;) and one of the most downloaded songs of all time under their belts: GRAMMY-nominated &ldquo;Hey There Delilah.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The quintet first came to Fearless Records in early 2000, releasing their certified gold albums, <em>All That We Needed<\/em>, and later in conjunction with Hollywood Records, <em>Every Second Counts<\/em>, featuring mega-hit single \"Hey There Delilah,\" which propelled the band to superstardom and lead them to become one of the most praised bands in American rock.

But as far as the Bronx native had come with her band, Hurray for the Riff Raff, there was still a missing link to her story. \"The more I toured, ending up in the middle of nowhere bars from Texas to Tennessee,\" said Segarra, \"I just started feeling more and more like, I don't belong here, I gotta get back to my people, you know?\"<br \/><br \/>After many years in New Orleans, Segarra found herself getting antsy. Hurray for the Riff Raff had four albums under its belt, with the last one, Small Town Heroes, featuring \"The Body Electric,\" a song that NPR's Ann Powers called \"The Political Song of the Year\" in 2014. Yet even though her musical career had begun by running away from home at 17, busking for survival and honing her craft through dreams of Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Memphis Minnie, and Woody Guthrie, Segarra realized she is a Puerto Rican kid from the Bronx with a different story to tell.<br \/><br \/>To find her way back home, Segarra became the willing vessel for a character she calls \"The Navigator,\" from which her new album takes its name. She describes The Navigator, a\/k\/a Navita Milagros Negr&oacute;n, as \"this girl who grows up in a city that's like New York, who's a street kid, like me when I was little, that has a special place in the history of her people.\" Through The Navigator, the listener hears an ambitiously interwoven, cinematic story of a wandering soul that finally realized she needed to connect with and honor her ancestors.<br \/><br \/>Segarra quickly went to work with producer Paul Butler, whose work with British soul singer Michael Kiwanuka she deeply admired, to capture the cinematic, old but new quality she wanted. It also meant assembling a core group of percussionists like Kansas City-based Juan-Carlos Chaurand and Devendra Banhart's drummer Gregory Rogove to play everything from Cuban to Puerto Rican to Brazilian backing beats. The result is an interconnected set of introspective songs, grounded in Segarra's eclectic rustic root style, yet adorned by elements of son montuno, plena, and a kind of Mink De Ville retro-doowop rock.<br \/><br \/>Segarra drew early inspiration from cult favorite Rodriguez, a Mexican-American who translated working-class stories from Detroit into powerful rock ballads, and the Ghetto Brothers, an underground band from the 1970s South Bronx who stitched Puerto Rican nationalist messages into a rough-hewn fabric of Santana and Sly and the Family Stone Afro-Caribbean funk. She reached back to her cultural ancestors in the form of the radical political group the Young Lords and the salsa singer H&eacute;ctor Lavoe. \"I would just try to have the rhythm in my head and write the lyrics,\" said Segarra. \"Then I went back and added everything else, it was like poetry?\"<br \/><br \/>Poetry permeates The Navigator, like when Segarra juxtaposes the feeling of growing up in a box in the sky on the 14th floor of an apartment building with the feeling her father had flying for what seemed like an eternity in a propeller plane from Puerto Rico to New York in the song \"14th Floor.\" Or when, in the elegiac piano-driven ballad \"Pa'lante,\" named after the Young Lords newspaper that showed the way forward, she inserts the sampled voice of legendary poet Pedro Pietri reading from his seminal opus \"The Puerto Rican Obituary.\" The Navigator is a restless observer, perched at the nexus of Allen Ginsberg's East Village and the Nuyorican Poets Caf&eacute;, confessing the blues and dancing the punky salsa steps of a lonely girl, a hungry ghost.<br \/><br \/>Like a song-cycle from an imaginary Off-Broadway musical, The Navigator rises from the ashes of loneliness and striving, honky tonks and long walks by the river of urban dreams. From the wistful melancholy of \"Life to Save,\" to the stubborn resignation of \"Nothing's Gonna Change That Girl,\" Segarra's voice speaks with a husky weariness that coexists with a na&iuml;ve curiosity. It's the voice of a rebel who wanted everyone to think she was so tough, and nobody could take her down, but at the same time was yearning for love and magic, some kind of an awakening.Long-time Riff Raff fans should feel at home in The Navigator's World. There's always been a little bit of syncopated Caribbean strut to down home rock and roll, Appalachian rags share a similar root with Spanish troubadours and the blues is the same in any language. On The Navigator, Segarra's voice has never been more soulful, whether she's decrying urban gentrification on \"Rican Beach\" or mourning the lies people tell on \"Halfway There.\" Like the moment we're living in, The Navigator is as much about the past as it is the future.<br \/><br \/>With its 12 tracks and its Travelers, Sages, and Sirens, The Navigator comes straight at you from the intersection of apocalypse and hope. This album rides Patti Smith's high horse while straddling a thin line between love and hate. Segarra may lament the Trumpsters who want to \"build a wall and keep them out,\" but she knows that, like the outcasts she embraces, \"Any day now\/I will come along.\" There'll be no more hiding at the dimly lit intersections of class, race, and sexual identity -- now we will all come into the light.<br \/><br \/>\"I feel like my generation, through groups like Black Lives Matter, is really focusing on that type of intersectionality -- if one of us is not free, then none of us are free,\" said Segarra. \"The Navigator's role is to tell the story, tell it to the people who don't know their own story, so they can be free.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_HurrayForTheRiffRaff_10_56_35_AM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/hurrayfortheriffraff.com\/"},{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hurrayfortheriffraff"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hurrayfortheriffraff\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2xLEV2jDreAOcpJXFNoXyt"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HFTRR"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/HFTRRVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:01 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lissie":{"id":"3785","name":"Lissie","friendly_url":"lissie","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>Lissie grew up in Rock Island, Illinois, near the Mississippi River, speaking her mind and writing songs from an early age.

Now, on September 1, 2017, Boney James will release his 16th album, this one titled Honestly. If you sense a direct line between those titles, you&rsquo;ve already come a long way toward understanding what motivates the four-time GRAMMY nominee and multi-platinum-selling musician.<br \/> <br \/> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fighting the good fight to be my own artist and not be pigeonholed,&rdquo; says the genre-blurring James. &ldquo;With a record&rsquo;s title I always try to find something that will communicate the feeling I get when I listen to it. The feeling I get with this music is a sense of sincerity and intimacy. The word &lsquo;honestly&rsquo; really reflects how I aspire to live my life and create my music. One of the great things about music is how powerful it is. It can totally transport people. These are interesting times we are living in and the one thing I can do with the skills that I have is to make music that evokes a feeling and takes people somewhere&hellip; to do what I can to try and make the world a more pleasant place.&rdquo;<br \/> <br \/> Honestly follows futuresoul, James&rsquo; 2015 release which spent eleven weeks at #1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart. The New York Times raved, &ldquo;Boney James performs with panache...His arc as a soloist is emotional...he can paint a scene.&rdquo;<br \/> <br \/> His skill as a performer as well as a recording artist garnered this notice from the Boston Globe, &ldquo;James swaggered across the stage like a blacktop hero draining treys on an overmatched opponent. He even weaved his way through the audience, never missing a beat and all but daring the crowd not to have a good time.\"<br \/> <br \/> Over the years, James has racked up sales of more than three million records, four RIAA gold albums, four GRAMMY nominations, a Soul Train Award, nominations for two NAACP Image Awards and 10 CDs atop Billboard&rsquo;s Contemporary Jazz Albums chart. In 2009, Billboard named him one of the Top 3 Contemporary Jazz Artists Of The Decade along with Kenny G and Norah Jones.<br \/> <br \/> With Honestly, as with futuresoul and the GRAMMY-nominated The Beat before it, Boney James is making some of the most stellar, wholly realized music of his career. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just grown up, personally and musically,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lot calmer now when I approach making music and have more confidence. I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;give-110 percent&rdquo; kind of person and I&rsquo;m enjoying the process more now. I think that comes out in the music. Maybe that&rsquo;s why this new record is so much fun to listen to.

It&rsquo;s not a matter of omens or conjecture either, but rather time and facts. The Nashville-based group&mdash; <strong>Ricky Young<\/strong> [guitar, vocals], <strong>Taylor Burns<\/strong> [guitar, vocals], <strong>Joel King<\/strong> [bass, vocals], <strong>Preston Wimberly<\/strong> [guitar, vocals], and <strong>Ben Dumas<\/strong> [drums]&mdash;spent more than two years on the road supporting their 2013 debut self-titled full-length album. Their diligence slowly but surely started to pay off as the record hit #1 on <em>Billboard<\/em>&rsquo;s Heatseekers Chart, and they received invites to appear on <em>Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O Brien<\/em>, <em>Seth Meyers, Craig Ferguson<\/em>, ABC&rsquo;s <em>Nashville<\/em>, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Along the way, unanimous critical praise arrived courtesy of <em>Rolling Stone<\/em>,<em> New York Times<\/em>, <em>Huffington Post<\/em>, <em>USA Today<\/em>, and countless others. Simultaneously, the quintet turned casual listeners into staunch believers with incendiary and invigorating performances at festivals and touring with everybody from Bob Dylan to Gary Clark Jr. Throughout this whirlwind, they kept thinking about the next evolution and started writing songs for what would become their 2016 sophomore effort, <strong><em>Lonely Is A Lifetime<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The story of this album starts with all of the touring we did,&rdquo; Ricky remarks. &ldquo;We progressed as a live band. When we wrote our first record, we knew what we liked, but we didn&rsquo;t really know who we were yet. The more we toured and grew into ourselves, the more we started to naturally move towards what we are today&mdash;as individuals and musicians. After playing the same songs every night, you eventually start leaning towards other things. We wrote music that we wanted to play.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think we subconsciously pick up influences everywhere we go,&rdquo; says Preston. &ldquo;That includes the bands we tour with, the record stores we visit, and the fans we meet. Whether it's intentional or not, we take something away from each and every city and experience.\"<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll band who can play all different kinds of things,&rdquo; adds Taylor. &ldquo;We made a conscious effort to expand our sound. We went into the writing mode on the same page. We wanted to preserve the essence of <strong>The Wild Feathers<\/strong> with the multiple harmonies, but we also wanted to take this step forward and experiment.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As a result, <strong><em>Lonely Is a Lifetime<\/em><\/strong> reflects a richer confluence of influences, while maintaining their signature soul and spirit and a nod to all that time on the road together. Following the first album&rsquo;s marathon of touring, the band retreated to a cabin in Muscle Shoals, AL. It was there they collectively sifted through the myriad ideas accrued on the road. Their three singular voices began to shine within the new material, giving a platform to their respective identities as both singers and writers.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I first hooked up with these guys, I was very competitive,&rdquo; admits Taylor. &ldquo;I realized they can elevate my songs to a higher place than I can by myself. We all feel the same way. We&rsquo;re working towards a common goal now&mdash;to put out the best album possible. When you&rsquo;ve got three songwriters, everyone has to earn three seals of approval. That pushes you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They then traded Muscle Shoals for Barcelona, welcoming another spirit of inspiration on the other side of the world. Ben adds, &ldquo;This record definitely has traces of everywhere we&rsquo;ve been and everything we&rsquo;ve experienced in the past couple of years, and that&rsquo;s what makes it special.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They took the songs back to Nashville and once again tapped the talents of producer Jay Joyce, who has done everything from Cage the Elephant to Wallflowers and Coheed and Cambria, as well as bringing on Dave Sardy (Oasis, Band Of Horses, Death From Above 1979) to shake it up in the mix.<\/p>\n<p>Recorded in a little over a month&rsquo;s time, the first single <strong>&ldquo;Overnight&rdquo;<\/strong> most clearly illuminates the aforementioned evolution tempering lush guitars with infectious choruses. Meanwhile, they struck a balance between ethereal ambiance on <strong>&ldquo;Sleepers&rdquo;<\/strong> and the epic surge of the eight-minute <strong>&ldquo;Goodbye Song&rdquo;<\/strong>&mdash;which Taylor describes as, &ldquo;his favorite moment in the studio.&rdquo; Between the rustle of guitars and a heavenly lyrical lead, it&rsquo;s emblematic of <strong>The Wild Feathers&rsquo;<\/strong> progression.<\/p>\n<p>About <strong>&ldquo;Goodbye Song,&rdquo;<\/strong> Ricky says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d been messing around with that melody and hook for a long time. It finally clicked. The story of the song is that of an addict. He could be addicted to drugs or alcohol, but he&rsquo;s basically saying, &lsquo;I am who I am. Take it or leave it.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the moment of giving up. We unabashedly embraced the Pink Floyd vibe. We didn&rsquo;t want to rip it off; we just wanted to apply it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask Me to Change,&rdquo;<\/strong> culminates on a smoky and soulful refrain that&rsquo;s instantly unshakable. Meanwhile, they collectively penned the impassioned psychedelic chant of <strong>&ldquo;Into the Sun&rdquo; <\/strong>where bright harmonies collide with hypnotic instrumentation. The upbeat melodic bliss of <strong>&ldquo;On My Way&rdquo; <\/strong>marks the first time all five members wrote on the same song, while the album&rsquo;s conclusion <strong>&ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;<\/strong> finds grace in airy production and emotional delivery from Taylor.<\/p>\n<p>The album&rsquo;s title encapsulates the group&rsquo;s reverence for their heroes. On the anniversary of Gram Parsons&rsquo; birthday, the boys were working on music in Los Angeles. Given the proximity to Joshua Tree, they made a pilgrimage to The Joshua Tree Hotel where the legend died. They stayed in his final hotel room and wrote &ldquo;Lonely is a Lifetime.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a nod to their foundation.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We were on a huge Gram Parsons kick, and we had to book the room,&rdquo; says Joel. &ldquo;We went out there just for the experience. It ended up being a magical thing because we wrote this song in 45 minutes. It was inspiring.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In the end, <strong>The Wild Feathers<\/strong> deliver a statement with the eleven songs on <strong><em>Lonely Is A Lifetime<\/em><\/strong>. They&rsquo;ve grown as men and musicians, and they&rsquo;re ready to claim their spot in the canon of American rock music.<\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WildFeathersThe_8_20_48_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 7 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 7","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheWildFeathers"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.thewildfeathers.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thewildfeathers"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheWildFeathersVids"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thewildfeathers\/#"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5YENCIQVzziCFdoVWc26Bn"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:06:40 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"knox-fortune":{"id":"3838","name":"Knox Fortune","friendly_url":"knox-fortune","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>Chicago's Kevin Rhomberg, aka Knox Fortune, is an in-demand singer, songwriter, and producer with a quirky, genre-bending sound that touches upon hip-hop, '60s-style pop, and indie rock.

The title,&nbsp;<em>Content,&nbsp;<\/em>sees Joywave apply their trademark irreverence and &nbsp;humor &nbsp;to two large yet interrelated ideas springing from the dual meaning of the word, &ldquo;content&rdquo;, and &nbsp;signaling a move &nbsp;into a deeply personal terrain for Joywave frontman Daniel Armbruster.<\/p>\n<p>About the duality reflected in the album&rsquo;s title (CONtent the noun &nbsp;versus conTENT the adjective), Armbruster says:<em>&rdquo;I loved that the two words &nbsp;were associated with completely opposite feelings for me&nbsp; (one pure, one not), and that only a human hearing the two words &nbsp;in the English language could tell the difference between the ideas represented. To a search engine, they are identical. How can you explain to Google that one of these things makes you happy &nbsp;and helps fill the void in your soul, and the other is just flooding your senses?&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Three years have &nbsp;passed since Joywave&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tongues&rdquo;and their collaboration with Big Data on the hit song &ldquo;Dangerous&rdquo; first put the band on the map. &nbsp;Creating their own imprint Cultco Music via Hollywood Records, the five members of Joywave&mdash;Daniel Armbruster (vocals), Joseph Morinelli (guitar), Sean Donnelly (bass), Benjamin Bailey (keyboards), and &nbsp;Paul Brenner (drums)&mdash; embarked on an intense tour schedule in support of their debut album, sharing the stage with Foals, The Killers, Brandon Flowers, Metric, Silversun Pickups and &nbsp;Bleachers. They played at Coachella, Lollapalooza (US &amp; Berlin), Reading &amp; Leeds, Okeechobee, Osheaga, Hangout and &nbsp;Bumbershoot, with appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and &nbsp;Seth &nbsp;Meyers&rsquo; shows. Glowing reviews followed in&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Billboard<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>Spin&nbsp;<\/em>and &nbsp;<em>Entertainment Weekly<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This success enabled Armbruster to seriously adult on a whole new level, and &nbsp;this year he finally moved into a place of his own, a few blocks away from his childhood home. For Armbruster, who sold stationery and &nbsp;paper goods at Staples before Joywave took off, the musical dream born when &nbsp;he started writing songs aged fifteen was finally coming true. The single&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s A Trip!&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong>began with two basic ideas in mind: &ldquo;Haunting&rdquo; versus &ldquo;haunted&rdquo;.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I wanted to make &nbsp;something undeniably beautiful that would outlast me, &nbsp;but at times verged on the absurd &nbsp;and snapped the listener out of a dreamy haze. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s A Trip!&rdquo; moves pretty &nbsp;far in the absurd &nbsp;direction, juxtaposing a pretty &nbsp;friendly arena-sized chorus against versus straight out of a haunted house. The song &nbsp;is a little disorienting, much like the past &nbsp;few years of our lives have been&rdquo;.&nbsp;<\/em>The music video for &ldquo;It&rsquo;s A Trip!&rdquo; features the band slowly aging as they ride jet skis in<\/p>\n<p>Miami and &nbsp;underscores the sense of endlessly being on tour, just getting older while the girl on the back &nbsp;of the jet ski stays the same age.<\/p>\n<p>Touring&mdash;which Armbruster describes as &ldquo;an episode of&nbsp;<em>Louie&nbsp;<\/em>where &nbsp;it&rsquo;s funny but somewhat soul crushingly sad at the same time&rdquo;&mdash;took its toll on the band both &nbsp;physically and emotionally but had &nbsp;an upside. &nbsp;&ldquo;Playing our instruments was second nature at that point,&rdquo; notes guitarist Joey Morinelli, that allowed us to focus and &nbsp;interact with crowds, and &nbsp;each other &nbsp;on stage, in ways that we never &nbsp;had &nbsp;before.&ldquo;<\/p>\n<p>Post tour, Armbruster who had &nbsp;been dealing with chronic illness was diagnosed with pancreatitis, and &nbsp;had &nbsp;to stop drinking on doctor&rsquo;s orders. Sobriety &ldquo;really affected the sound of the record,&rdquo; he says. In contrast to Joywave&rsquo;s playful debut, the tone &nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Content&nbsp;<\/em>is more confessional, sometimes combative, as it questions how connected we really are in this hyper-connected world&mdash;which brings us to&nbsp;<em>Content<\/em>&rsquo;s second theme, stemming from the collective angst of a generation whose art (and very lives) are now mere &nbsp;<em>content&nbsp;<\/em>for the Internet. &nbsp;Sonically,&nbsp;<em>Content&nbsp;<\/em>is more &nbsp;cohesive than &nbsp;Joywave's LP1,&nbsp;<em>How Do You Feel Now? &nbsp;<\/em>It&rsquo;s focused and &nbsp;deliberate, loud and &nbsp;cinematic featuring a more &nbsp;prominent vocal throughout LP2.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;As a clear example of conscious, positive content; the title track &nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;Content&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/strong>is accompanied with a video shot on vintage Super 8 on location at&nbsp;<strong>Kodak Tower&nbsp;<\/strong>in Rochester. The building, once the global epicenter of film photography, is a monument to the pre-Internet world in the Rochester skyline and &nbsp;a place that&rsquo;s close to the hearts of all bandmembers, as most of their parents worked &nbsp;there &nbsp;before Kodak filed for bankruptcy. In addition, Kodak has afforded the band the opportunity to utilize some of their iconic equipment which inspired Daniel to take &nbsp;up film photography to help fill the existential void.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Film is slower and more &nbsp;deliberate, and that&rsquo;s calming in a way. It's not disposable, it's not easy, &nbsp;which in turn, forces you to care. I like that.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>At the end &nbsp;of the day music is at the core &nbsp;of what Joywave is and &nbsp;drives the creativity in every aspect. &nbsp;Brenner sums it up, &ldquo;We're always working on new music and &nbsp;new ways to make &nbsp;our live performance better and &nbsp;better. Joywave will not be confined to a certain genre or niche.

A career that has seen the release of eight albums, two ASCAP Songwriter of the Year trophies, Billboard Country Songwriter of the Year, countless hits as a singer and songwriter and a mantle full of awards and the launch of his own Rodeowave Entertainment label continues to expand and evolve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a singer\/songwriter, Phil has hit the Top 5 seven times with songs like &ldquo;Carlene,&rdquo; &ldquo;Last Day of My Life&rdquo; and &ldquo;American Child&rdquo; and topped the charts with &ldquo;In A Real Love&rdquo; and the perennial favorite &ldquo;Just Another Day in Paradise.&rdquo; Known as one of Nashville&rsquo;s top tunesmiths, his songs other artists have taken to #1 include &ldquo;My Next Thirty Years&rdquo; by Tim McGraw, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Right On The Money&rdquo; by Alan Jackson, and Jo Dee Messina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bye, Bye&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Alright.&rdquo; New artist David Nail had a hit with Phil&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Sound of a Million Dreams,&rdquo; which Billboard named the #1 song in their Top 10 Country Songs of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Vassar continues to churn out incisive, soulful lyrics and infectious melodies that capture the heart and soul in the unique and special way that only he can, and his latest single, &ldquo;Love Is Alive,&rdquo; is no exception. Written with frequent co-writer, the award-winning Tom Douglas (&ldquo;The House That Built Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Run To You&rdquo;), the new release is the foundation for a much-anticipated new album that will hit stores on Rodeowave in mid-2013.<\/p>\n<p>For Vassar, his philosophy about songs has never changed during his time spent writing hits for himself and other artists, it&rsquo;s important for a song to carry a message and make the listener feel something.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Songs should evoke something, whether it makes you happy and puts you in a good mood, or makes you cry and feel desperation&hellip;you know, whether you&rsquo;re going through a marriage, or a divorce, or you&rsquo;re in love or you hate somebody, or whatever it is&hellip; songs should evoke something,&rdquo; says Vassar. &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s just having a drink with your friends in the hot tub, that&rsquo;s just as good as any song for me! I mean, I&rsquo;ve had hits with every kind of song &ndash; ballads, mid-tempos, up-tempos and silly kinds of songs.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t save the whales with every song you write, that&rsquo;s too heavy for me,&rdquo; he adds, laughing. &ldquo;I honestly don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve written my best songs yet,&rdquo; he added.<\/p>\n<p>His critically-acclaimed holiday release Noel included five original and five classic songs and a slight dose of irreverence. Sandwiched between &ldquo;Away in a Manger&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Home For Christmas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Gone Hollywood&rdquo; is an equal opportunity offender for everything good and pure about jolly ole St. Nick. He supported the album with a Christmas tour, which he plans to make an annual event.<\/p>\n<p>The Virginia native, who received the 2012 VAB Distinguished Virginian Award by the Virginia Association of Broadcasters is definitely no stranger to a good time, and he makes sure with every performance that his fans feel exactly the same way. Years of playing clubs, and even owning his own nightspot at one point, helped Phil cultivate the easygoing, fun-loving manner he displays onstage and the infectious energy that infuses every single show he does.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always prided myself on writing a lot of different types of songs, while some people may like to play it safe, I prefer diversity. So it&rsquo;s about new energy and doing different things, getting away from the old ways and starting fresh, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been able to do with Rodeowave.&rdquo;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Excited at the limitless possibilities of the freedom of running his own label, he is also extending the knowledge and experience he has gained over the years to other artists. The full-service record label\/promotions\/management company not only handles details of his own career but has promoted music by The Lumineers, Neal McCoy, and new artists Miss Willie Brown, High Valley, Old Dominion and Sam Riddle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The company is also the launch pad for television and film projects. A new movie called Fat Biscuit will begin shooting in the fall of 2013. His love of travel, food and meeting new people heavily influenced a TV project currently in production. No stranger to television, Phil was nominated for an Emmy Award in the \"Outstanding Original Song\" category for his composition \"Live For Today,\" which performed and produced for a recurring series on NBC's Today Show.<\/p>\n<p>When not on the road performing for adoring fans or at home taking care of the business that surrounds Phil Vassar, he can be found picking up his two daughters from school and spending the afternoon just being &ldquo;Dad.&rdquo; His heart for children extends well beyond his immediate family, and 2013 marks the sixth year he has performed a benefit concert for The Miller Home for girls in his hometown. He has been a featured artist on Charlie Daniels&rsquo; annual Christmas 4 Kids concert, and he regularly lends his time, talent and name to organizations like St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital, Monroe Carell, Jr. Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Vanderbilt, Second Harvest Food Bank and more.<\/p>\n<p>Phil Vassar is an artist who has endured his share of ups and downs in life and the &ldquo;biz,&rdquo; and one who is not only riding a diverse wave of success but sharing it with others. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going out there to try and change the world, but for me, this is my thing, this is my little world that I can control now, and I&rsquo;m really excited about this journey, getting new music out to the fans and working on other avenues to entertain people. For me that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PhilVassar_2_44_25_PM_2_13_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 10:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"10:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/philvassar"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.philvassar.com\/"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/philvassar\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/OfficialPhilVassar"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/philvassar\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1XhhO2dTs2fKyhILj0aam6"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:42 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"maxi-priest":{"id":"3766","name":"Maxi Priest","friendly_url":"maxi-priest","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p>Only a handful of singers succeed in transcending their genre without losing the essence of who they are. Superstar Maxi Priest is one of those artists whose own unique vision has led him to tremendous international success, being the first reggae artist to have a No. 1 hit worldwide, including the U.S. Billboard charts.<\/p>\n<p>His new album, Easy To Love is as fine a representation of lovers&rsquo; rock as you could possibly wish for. The sophistication he brings to these tracks is the mark of true quality; his effortless blend of reggae, R&amp;B and dancehall has universal appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Lead single &ldquo;Easy To Love,&rdquo; was a No. 1 smash hit on the reggae charts last summer &ndash;evidence that Maxi Priest has a gift for staying fresh. The song features the legendary Jamaican drum and bass duo Sly &amp; Robbie, who&rsquo;ve played on some of Maxi&rsquo;s biggest hits, including &ldquo;Wild World,&rdquo; &ldquo;Some Guys Have All The Luck,&rdquo; &ldquo;Close To You,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Housecall&rdquo; (featuring Shabba Ranks), as well as the new album track &ldquo;Every Little Thing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Without A Woman&rdquo; features Beres Hammond, and echoes the themes and intensity of James Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Man&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s Man&rsquo;s World.&rdquo; Maxi and Beres&rsquo; musical partnership began years ago with the crossover hit &ldquo;How Can We Ease The Pain.&rdquo; Time has deepened the understanding between them and there&rsquo;s so much soul in this track it hurts. &ldquo;This song is an appreciation for all women and a gift from the artists,&rdquo; says Maxi. &ldquo;Sometimes we forget to simply say &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; &ndash; as without you, there is no us.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This album is about time, and a moment,&rdquo; says Maxi Priest. When singing &ldquo;Angel Wings,&rdquo; Maxi envisioned himself in Jamaica surrounded by nature. The delicate, aching need of this track demonstrates just how far reggae has evolved in the new era. Other tracks, like &ldquo;Fire In The Skies&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Could Be The One,&rdquo; simply defy categorization and are living proof of Maxi Priest&rsquo;s musical versatility.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, I&rsquo;m from a church background,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;My mother, a missionary, is where I would hear the beautiful sound of gospel, mixed in with reggae music that my older brothers played around the house. My sisters were into the Jackson Five, The Beatles, Al Green, etc. From an early age my family always encouraged me&hellip; I listened to all kinds of vocalists&hellip; Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Dennis Brown&hellip; without realizing it, I was developing my craft. I was taught never to limit myself &ndash; that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll always find different styles of music on my albums, and a range of producers to bring out different aspects of my creativity.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Gravity,&rdquo; written by John Mayer, is an example of what happens when someone of Maxi&rsquo;s caliber takes a song to heart; like Marvin Gaye or John Holt, he&rsquo;s long mastered the art of romance. His delivery and phrasing are impeccable, and so too his choices of material and collaborators.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hearts Across The World&rdquo; is a centerpiece of the album and sends out a message to the global village. It&rsquo;s a song for our times, which stems from a genuine desire to help uplift humanity. With lyrics like &ldquo;no one&rsquo;s going to cry tonight \/ everyone in the world, dry eyes,&rdquo; the song is a plea for people of all races to love one another.<\/p>\n<p>New and long-term fans alike will relish hearing tracks like &ldquo;Loving You Is Easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Holiday,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Still In Love,&rdquo; &ndash; irresistible tributes of enduring affection. Maxi&rsquo;s been tugging on girls&rsquo; heartstrings ever since the mid-80&rsquo;s, when he dominated the UK reggae charts with hits like &ldquo;Should I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strollin&rsquo; On.&rdquo; Maxi&rsquo;s version of John McLean&rsquo;s &ldquo;If I Gave My Heart To You&rdquo; is a reminder of when Maxi Priest&rsquo;s star was still ascending. Now, with over 15 million albums sold worldwide, he is the most successful solo act in British reggae history and has earned the respect of fellow artists from all over the world.<\/p>\n<p>Maxi Priest is the first British-born singer to graduate from the London reggae sound-system Saxon Studio International, introducing the sound of lovers&rsquo; rock to a global audience. Before joining Saxon, Maxi embraced Rastafari and served an apprenticeship with South London sound-system Negus Negast and the legendary Jah Shaka. Maxi has adhered to these principles his entire career by making conscious music of all kinds. While Easy To Love is essentially an album of love songs, it closes with a track first recorded by Ras Michael and the Sons of Negus in the 1970&rsquo;s. Maxi&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;None A Jah Jah Children&rdquo; is strikingly original. It is intended as a blessing to see us safely on our way as we&rsquo;re transported to a Rasta grounation or Nyahbinghi &ndash; a gathering of the faithful where we receive affirmation that no matter the hardships, Jah Jah&rsquo;s children will always triumph.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MaxiPriest_8_30_22_AM_3_29_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 7 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 7","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/maxipriest"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/therealmaxipriest\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3aTuTR5Nf6pVW3837q2ZL7"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/maxipriest"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/maxipriest.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/maxipriestmusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/29\/2018 08:30:55 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"devin-dawson":{"id":"3769","name":"Devin Dawson","friendly_url":"devin-dawson","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 5","description":"<p>Since the release of Devin Dawson&rsquo;s debut single &ldquo;All On Me&rdquo; earlier this year, the California-native has already made his TV debut on&nbsp;<em>Late Night with Seth Meyers,&nbsp;<\/em>landed his first Grand Ole Opry performance and most recently was named a 2018 Pandora &ldquo;Country Artist to Watch.&rdquo; He has already received critical praise from a multitude of outlets including&nbsp;<em>Entertainment Tonight, ELLE, People, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The Tennessean, HITS Magazine&nbsp;<\/em>and more.

It showed me a way out of the woods, and I entered the Wild. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to embrace the adventures of the unknown.&rdquo; CVBZ emerges from the cold embrace of those branches; wide-eyed and hopeful. Answering that distant voice in all of us to do more; leaving the rain-soaked permagrey of Portland, OR; taking his physical and musical body to the wide open future awaiting him in Southern California. The first defiant step of that journey for CVBZ begins with his stunning debut single, &ldquo;Be Like You.\"<\/p>\n<p>With all the makings of a hit record, while also fully immersed in the undefinable uniqueness that is CVBZ, &ldquo;Be Like You&rdquo; has already amassed well over 4 million streams on Spotify, entering viral territory in the US, Canada, the UK, and Belgium, where it&rsquo;s peaked at #1 on its respective chart. The song is perfect parts trop-house and pop, exploring the landscape of admiration for another soul. It has been featured on Spotify playlists including New Music Friday, Chill Tracks, dancePOP, and Fun Work Out, among others. On YouTube, the song has been supported by stylish channels Mr Revillz, The Vibe Guide XO and Cloud Kid and has received online coverage from PopOnAndOn, ThisSongSlaps and AllThingsGo. CVBZ; a bit of a mad musical scientist; shapes his ideas and original productions on his phone; while still immersed in the real world around him; allowing the songs, while being gigantic pop songs, to still feel honest and intimate because of the creative process. While originally self-released, CVBZ has now partnered with Ultra and Sony labels worldwide to expose this captivating single to eager ears worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>\"I always wanted to be something different: someone else, somewhere new. We all aspire to be better&mdash; like that certain \"someone\"&mdash; I wrote 'Be Like You' was when I finally realized I was that person all along,\" explains CVBZ. \"This song is the culmination of six years of exploratory music making, two years of study abroad, a run down iPhone 5 and a perfect concoction of self-discovery.\" This is the song that helped CVBZ find both himself and the identity of the project.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;'Be Like You' was written for people like myself, who dance along the outskirts of society, orbiting the normative sociosphere, just waiting for something to give,\" says CVBZ. \"It's human nature to want more, to be better, to fit in&mdash; after all, where would humanity be if we never sought to improve our existence?&mdash; but perfection is ephemeral. It is 'the great lie' of human consciousness, because if all parts were built the same, the whole cannot function. When I realized this, I knew I was ready to be something special&mdash; me.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CVBZ_5_21_16_PM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 4 - 9:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 4","start_time":"9:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cvbzmvzic\/?ref=page_internal"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cvbzmvzic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0pt7PX4Hftlg8mV1ySU84Q"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cvbzmvzic?lang=en"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.cadeofficial.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/cademusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/29\/2018 08:49:28 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"carlie-hanson":{"id":"3854","name":"Carlie Hanson","friendly_url":"carlie-hanson","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":[],"image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CarlieHanson_3_48_17_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"June 30 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"June 30","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carliehanson2000"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/carliehanson\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3mPc8WGusz2XF3Tvs3AKCR"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/carliehanson"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCuqu1jzrhohanLyGT_gDodA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/02\/2018 11:46:47 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"candlebox":{"id":"3767","name":"Candlebox","friendly_url":"candlebox","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p>Currently celebrating their 25<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary, multi-platinum rock band Candlebox has not only withstood the test of time but, more importantly, they&rsquo;ve withstood trends, trials and tribulations and come out stronger for it. Because for this hard-working band out of Seattle, the goal has always been the same &ndash; to create iconic music that would last a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>Taking their name after a Midnight Oil song, Candlebox burst onto the scene in 1991 with their debut, self-titled album that went on to sell more than four million copies, was certified four times platinum, and landed them in the number 7 spot on the Billboard Charts.<\/p>\n<p>Their follow up album <em>Lucy<\/em> was also well received earning them a platinum certification and solidifying them as a tour de force in the thriving 90s music scene. The band would then go on to release <em>Happy Pills<\/em> in 1998, which would be their last album before their eventual hiatus in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>The driving force behind Candlebox&rsquo;s success has been their explosive live show and throughout their career, they&rsquo;ve toured with such bands as Living Colour, The Flaming Lips, Our Lady Peace, Rush, Henry Rollins, Metallica and more. They were also a featured band on the main-stage at Woodstock '94 and made repeat live performances on the David Letterman show.<\/p>\n<p>They are best known for the singles \"Change\", \"You\", \"Far Behind\" and \"Simple Lessons\". \"Far Behind\" from their debut album entered Billboard's Top 20 in July of 1993 and didn't drop off the charts until January of 1994. The videos for \"Far Behind\" and \"You\" were in seemingly perpetual rotation on MTV and became two of the most requested videos of 1993.<\/p>\n<p>The band took a break from 2000 to 2006 and in 2008 the band reformed and released their fourth studio album called \"Into The Sun\". This meant their return since 1998's <em>Happy Pills<\/em>. Also, they released a live album called <em>Alive in Seattle<\/em>, which included tracks from all their past albums.<\/p>\n<p>Candlebox then spent years touring and released their sixth album <em>Disappearing in Airports<\/em>, which debuted at #9 on the Billboard Charts and spurred many tours including a successful European tour. In January of 2018, the group kicked off their much-publicized &ldquo;25 Years Of Rock &amp; Still Rolling Tour&rdquo; and announced two exclusive Seattle shows with all four original members, which sold out in minutes.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Candlebox_3_00_02_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 7 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 7","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/candlebox\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/candlebox_official\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3R6c2tWDBeYB1GncjLMn9n"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/candlebox"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.candleboxrocks.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/CBOXROCKERS"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:51 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jonny-lang":{"id":"3812","name":"Jonny Lang","friendly_url":"jonny-lang","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":"<p>It is hard to believe that at 36 years old Jonny Lang has already had a successful career for two decades. Easier to believe when you learn he released his first platinum record at 15&mdash;an age when many young people are just beginning to play music. <em>Lie to Me<\/em> revealed a talent that transcended the crop of blues prodigies floating around in the late Nineties. No flashy re-hasher of classic blues licks, even at that early age Lang was a full-blown artist with a style of his own. Also, setting Lang apart from the wunderkind crowd was a 15-year-old voice that sounded like a weathered soul shouter. Actual life experience was yet to come, and has been subsequently chronicled in a series of five uniformly excellent recordings. &ldquo;I got married, had kids, and that arc has been recorded on albums along the way,&rdquo; says Lang. &ldquo;There is a lot of personal history in there, and also some things that relate to world events.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>What began as a bluesy sound, influenced by electric pioneers like Albert Collins, B. B. King, and Buddy Guy, evolved over those recordings into a modern R&amp;B style closer to Stevie Wonder and contemporary gospel music. Lang&rsquo;s distinctive, blues-inflected licks appeared on every album, but became one element in a sea of passionately sung and tightly arranged songs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Signs<\/em>, set for release on September 8, 2017 via Concord Records, is not merely a return the artist&rsquo;s guitar-based beginnings, but an embodiment of an even more elemental sound. Beyond focusing attention on his soloing prowess, it is about recapturing the spirit of the early blues, where the guitar was front and center, fairly leaping out of the speakers. &ldquo;A lot of my earlier influences have been coming to the surface, like Robert Johnson, and Howlin&rsquo; Wolf,&rdquo; he reports. &ldquo;I have been appreciating how raw and unrefined that stuff is. I had an itch to emulate some of that and I think it shows in the songs. Still, I let the writing be what it was and that was sometimes not necessarily the blues.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In this simpler spirit, Lang, Drew Ramsey, and Shannon Sanders convened in a Los Angeles studio with some melodic and arranging ideas and proceeded to crank out a dozen basic tracks in a few days. With a bit of overdubbing and further recording in L.A. and Nashville, and some further help from Dwan Hill, Dennis Dodd and Josh Kelley, <em>Signs<\/em> was done. The record, which features funk, rock, and blues elements, is held together by Lang&rsquo;s distinctive playing and singing, and the lyrics, which center on themes of embattlement and self-empowerment. &ldquo;Some of the songs are autobiographical, but not usually in a literal way,&rdquo; Lang explains. &ldquo;The main goal is for folks to be able to relate to what I went through. If I can&rsquo;t make it work using just my personal experience, I use my imagination to fill in blanks.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Starting off the record with a juke joint stomp, &ldquo;Make It Move&rdquo; is the singer&rsquo;s story about going to the mountain rather than waiting for it to come to you. &ldquo;There have been times in my life where I thought something would take care of itself, when I should have put some effort forth to help it happen,&rdquo; says Lang. &ldquo;Being proactive has been a weak spot for me, and the song is about doing your part to get things moving.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Fueled by some evil guitar sounds, &ldquo;Snakes&rdquo; turns the well-known warning about &ldquo;snakes in the grass&rdquo; into a poetic tale of a young man dealing with hubris and temptation. &ldquo;It is mostly about the mistakes I made through not approaching life with humility, and the things I was susceptible to that distracted me,&rdquo; says Lang. &ldquo;You are overconfident, thinking you are ready for whatever the world will throw at you, but have no idea some things are affecting you until much later in life.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The anthemic &ldquo;Last Man Standing&rdquo; started with a hook Drew Ramsey brought to the recording date. &ldquo;We built the song around that premise,&rdquo; Lang explains. &ldquo;When I was coming up with lyrics, it was personal, but I don't want to analyze it too much. I want it to be whatever it is going to be for the listener. That song could be applied to any situation in which you feel like you are struggling.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Lang breaks out the slide for the title song, &ldquo;Signs,&rdquo; which extends outward from personal stories into the dramatic events of today&rsquo;s world. &ldquo;I try to disregard politics as much as I can, but it seems like every day when you wake up there is something else crazy going on&mdash;not normal crazy, but more like movie script crazy,&rdquo; he says.<\/p>\n<p>The rampaging guitars and driving groove of &ldquo;Bitter End&rdquo; reflect Lang&rsquo;s frustration with a seemingly endless cycle of history: &ldquo;Why tear down a wall to build it up again.&rdquo; But he brings us back up with the lilting affirmation of &ldquo;Stronger Together,&rdquo; and the funky exhortation to step &ldquo;Into the Light.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A stunning guitar solo marks the Josh Kelly produced &ldquo;Bring Me Back Home.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Josh and I cut six or seven songs together and had a blast doing it,&rdquo; Lang says. &ldquo;I am saving the other ones for who knows what, but I definitely wanted that one to be on this record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since the release of his debut album, Grammy Award winning Jonny Lang has built a reputation as one of the best live performers and guitarists of his generation.&nbsp;The path Lang has been on has brought him the opportunity to support or perform with some of the most respected legends in music.&nbsp; He has shared the stage with everyone from The Rolling Stones, B.B. King, Aerosmith and Buddy Guy, who he continues to tour with today.<\/p>\n<p>Fans who discovered Jonny Lang through his searing instrumental work will revel in the huge guitar tones and go for broke solos on <em>Signs<\/em>, while those who have appreciated his growth as an honest and passionate songwriter will find that honesty and passion unabated. Though he long ago left blues purism behind, Lang has never abandoned its spirit of universal catharsis through the relating of personal trials. <em>Signs <\/em>reaffirms his commitment to the blues and the guitar without sacrificing the modern approach that has made him such a singular artist.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JonnyLang_12_46_42_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 30 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 30","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JonnyLang"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jonnylangband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5rX1EodZfwxmW4fQX2Caot"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jonnylangband"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/jonnylang.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/JonnyLangMusic"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"great-white":{"id":"3796","name":"Great White","friendly_url":"great-white","stages":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>Changes? Yeah, they&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;em. Fallen off the path? Guilty. Slowed down? No way. Never.<\/p>\n<p><em>Full Circle<\/em>, the new album from Grammy nominated, multiplatinum recording artists, Great White, teams up the rock and roll band once again with its original producer, Michael Wagener. It&rsquo;s an honorable nod to their first EP <em>Out of the Night <\/em>(Aegean Records, 1983) and debut self-titled full-length record (EMI,1984). Wagener, is of course the legendary producer behind the iconic Alice Cooper, Megadeath, Metallica, Ozzy Osbourne and a slew of other rock gods. <em>Full Circle&rsquo;s <\/em>chemistry is palpable &ndash; Wagener&rsquo;s influence is immediately felt&hellip;but take note, this is not one-and-done swan song for a band that has churned out chromium-laced hard rock since the early &lsquo;80s.<\/p>\n<p>No, this is far from the word &lsquo;finished.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s back to work and back to where it starts &ndash; one song at a time.<\/p>\n<p>Recorded at Wagener&rsquo;s Nashville-based WireWorld Studio, Great White spent the majority of January and February 2017 sequestered in Music City. Set for worldwide release, June 2, <em>Full Circle&rsquo;s <\/em>packaging includes a must-have companion DVD called &ldquo;Making of Full Circle.&rdquo; Rockslide Entertainment (produced by Todd Sadowski) captured the band developing the songs in the studio &ndash; a never-before-seen band access. The footage is just another look at how Great White works together, puts egos aside for the love of their fans.<\/p>\n<p>Much like 2012&rsquo;s <em>Elation <\/em>(Frontiers Records) the core song writing team of Mark Kendall, Michael Lardie and Terry Ilous worked heavily alongside Audie Desbrow and Scott Snyder. The first single, &ldquo;Big Time&rdquo; is a sharp, cutting track. Their swagger and gladiator attitude is first-hand knowledge, and the listener is galvanized.<\/p>\n<p>In total, the 10 tracks on <em>Full Circle <\/em>range from the gut-punching &ldquo;Give It Up,&rdquo; to the bass-heavy &ldquo;Cry Of A Nation,&rdquo; the easily-embraced, more acoustic &ldquo;Let Me In,&rdquo; to the dynamic &ldquo;This Is The Life.&rdquo; <em>Full Circle <\/em>is overflowing with start-to-finish, balls to the wall, classic Great White triumphs.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t thank our fans enough for being there with us over all of these decades,&rdquo; Kendall said. &ldquo;It sounds insane to say decades, and when you think about it, that&rsquo;s how long it&rsquo;s been since we worked with Michael Wagener. Being excited in the studio with him is an understatement &ndash; he&rsquo;s a driving force and a legend behind the soundboard.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Great White is fueled by performing live &ndash; we love that energy that you can&rsquo;t find in the studio,&rdquo; Lardie said. &ldquo;But, when you do get us working on a new record, there&rsquo;s a bond that is forged &ndash; it&rsquo;s almost like alchemy&hellip;it&rsquo;s years of stories, heartache, momentum and love that we put to track.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Great White is Kendall (guitar), Lardie (guitar, keyboards), Desbrow (drums), Snyder (bass), and Ilous (vocals). Since 1982, the Great White sound has captivated audiences worldwide with crushing blues-based guitar riffs and swagger that invokes an emotional high for anyone that listens. The band&rsquo;s core writing team of Lardie and Kendall forged numerous hits over the years, and when Desbrow joined in &rsquo;85, the grooves hooked an amazing stride.<\/p>\n<p>For nearly a decade, Snyder has merged his unforgiving rhythm to Desbrow&rsquo;s relentless percussion. And, in 2011, Ilous&rsquo; feverish energy and far-stretching vocals melted perfectly into the Great White mold. Kendall calls Ilous &ldquo;the most consistent singer I&rsquo;ve ever shared the stage with and a great all-around musician.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Best known for their Grammy nominated Best Hard Rock Performance hit, &ldquo;Once Bitten, Twice Shy,&rdquo; Great White has sold over 10 million albums worldwide, has six Top 100 Billboard hits, nine Top 200 Billboard albums, two platinum albums, and clocked the top of MTV video four times.<\/p>\n<p>To experience their hits live in concert&mdash;&ldquo;Rock Me,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mista Bone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Save Your Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;House of Broken Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lady Red Light&rdquo;&mdash;is to ride an emotional wave of sultry connections, arousing lyrics, and an all-out marathon of hard-hitting orchestrations.<\/p>\n<p>Great White continues to tour worldwide and in the last two years logged nearly 200 dates in several states and countries. The band celebrated numerous milestones that included several sold-out performances, a return to the Zurich, Switzerland&rsquo;s Rock Im Tal Festival, and for the first time ever, a handful of intimate, acoustic performances.<\/p>\n<p>They returned to the classic rock radio charts with &ldquo;Complicated&rdquo; off of 2012&rsquo;s <em>Elation<\/em>. The band&rsquo;s 12th studio album, Elation, garnered high marks from numerous rock journalists behind the pesky &ldquo;Something For You,&rdquo; the cheeky &ldquo;Shotgun Willie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and the emotional, Top 10 classic rock radio entry, &ldquo;Hard To Say Goodbye.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_GreatWhite_2_46_19_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 1 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 1","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GreatWhiteOfficial"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/OfficialGreatWhite\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6ZPbX2Lxd40e2UVkXpyxvI"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/GreatWhiteRocks"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.officialgreatwhite.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/GreatWhiteBand"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:17 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"matthew-sweet":{"id":"3815","name":"Matthew Sweet","friendly_url":"matthew-sweet","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Tomorrow Forever, Matthew Sweet&rsquo;s fifth album of new material in this century, the first since 2011&rsquo;s Modern Art and 14th overall in a recording career spanning more than three decades, is teeming with his signature sounds and ongoing preoccupations. But the expansive 17-song work&mdash;available June 16, 2017 in CD, double 180-gram-vinyl LP, CD and digital configurations via Sweet&rsquo;s own newly launched Honeycomb Hideout imprint through Sony&rsquo;s RED Distribution&mdash;takes these familiar elements into previously unexplored territory, reflecting profound changes in his life. Essentially, Tomorrow Forever contemplates a knotty epistemological question: Does what is real extend beyond what the consciousness can readily grasp?<\/p>\n<p>In early 2014, Sweet, his wife Lisa and their cats moved from their longtime home in the Hollywood Hills to their native Nebraska. They bought a house on the outskirts of Omaha, 40 miles from Matthew&rsquo;s hometown of Lincoln, where his elderly parents still lived. The 80-year-old house was spacious enough to accommodate Matthew&rsquo;s high-end studio&mdash;formerly Lolina Lane, now Black Squirrel Submarine&mdash;and vast array of instruments, as well the Sweets&rsquo; collection of big-eyed art and Matthew&rsquo;s pottery-making tools.<\/p>\n<p>Soon after relocating to Nebraska, Matthew&rsquo;s team launched a Kickstarter fund in order to crowd-fund his next album, but before he&rsquo;d even gotten the project started, life happened. As he was getting acclimated to his old\/new surroundings, his mother passed away, spending her difficult final days surrounded by her family. Never before had Matthew experienced the loss of someone near to him, and it stopped him in his tracks. But an extended period of grieving was followed by one of the most fruitful sustained bursts of inspiration in his prolific career.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I started cranking out stuff, I did as many as I needed for that time,&rdquo; Matthew recalls. &ldquo;Before Ric [Menck] showed up to play drums, I got 10 or 15 ideas going, and then we played those. I eventually recorded 38 songs, and all of them are as pro as the ones on the record. There are things that for one reason or another didn&rsquo;t make it, but a lot of them go beyond what I wound up using. So in a way I was trying to bottle the essence of something that was even more sprawling and full of moodiness. The record is actually pretty simple compared to what went through my head while I was making it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With Matthew, the creative process is never calculated; ideas fly into his headspace, he grabs them as they come and takes a ride, not knowing the destination. In this flurry, they multiplied like Star Trek tribbles, eventually taking a coherent form in his mind.<\/p>\n<p>Purely in terms of its guitar payload, the new album is a breathtaking Fourth of July fireworks show, with axes trading volleys from the left and right channels in old-school-stereo fashion, as Sweet breaks out a lineup of killer players, each sporting a distinct style, like a modern-day Moby Grape or Buffalo Springfield. They shine on incandescent tracks like &ldquo;Trick of the Light,&rdquo; the power-pop instant classic that opens the album, the bristling, Zuma-esque midtempo churner &ldquo;Bittersweet&rdquo; and the glorious four-guitar jangle fest &ldquo;Music for Love.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Guitarists Jason Victor (Steve Wynn &amp; the Miracle 3, Dream Syndicate), Val McCallum (Jackson Browne), John Moremen (The Orange Peels), Gary Louris (The Jayhawks) and Paul Chastain (Velvet Crush) blaze away in various combinations alongside the rhythm section of Menck (Chastain&rsquo;s partner in Velvet Crush) and Sweet on bass and guitar; from song to song, he adds keys and Mellotron to his lead vocals and backing harmonies. The Bangles&rsquo; Debbi Peterson drums on four tracks, and The Zombies&rsquo; Rod Argent brings his elegant piano touch to &ldquo;Haunted,&rdquo; which unfurls with a &ldquo;Layla&rdquo;-like majesty, and &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; in which Matthew straps himself into his time capsule for another journey to and from the future.<\/p>\n<p>On the second song, &ldquo;Entangled,&rdquo; he ruminates on the nature of time, a metaphysical notion he&rsquo;s tackled throughout his discography, the rock &amp; roll equivalent of Kurt Vonnegut&rsquo;s celebrated novel Slaughterhouse Five. &ldquo;Follow time as it flows both ways,&rdquo; the chorus begins, &ldquo;Dreaming in another direction\/In universes all around\/We&rsquo;re meeting in another dimension\/Each one unaware.&rdquo; The song was inspired in part by Matthew&rsquo;s monitoring of physics courses online. &ldquo;&lsquo;Entanglement&rsquo; is a physics term,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;Einstein defined it as &lsquo;spooky action at a distance.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a hard-to-understand concept, where, if you change an electron on one end, the electron it&rsquo;s paired with changes on the other end. They don&rsquo;t have to be in the same place. Because you do one thing on this end, you know another thing happens on that end.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This interactive relationship could serve as a metaphor for the way Tomorrow Forever came together: Much of this interaction was done long-distance, 21st-century-style, as song files flew back and forth between Matthew and his collaborators over the Internet. After he and Menck finished a basic track, typically consisting of drums, bass, rhythm guitar and a scratch vocal, he sent it to each musician he&rsquo;d asked to contribute to the song in question, with the open-ended instruction, &ldquo;Play whatever you want.&rdquo; When the finished part arrived, Matthew experienced the cyberspace equivalent of &ldquo;Look what came in the mail today.&rdquo; He then wove the part into the track, building it piece by piece, while adding his multitracked backing vocals, any additional instrumentation he felt was needed and a lead vocal&mdash;although in several cases he wound up sticking with the original scratch vocal.<\/p>\n<p>As the ideas swarming in his head were coalescing into batches of songs, Matthew&rsquo;s fans were coming through big time. In the end, their donations to the Kickstarter fund would enable him to optimize every aspect of the project, from the elaborate gatefold packaging featuring harlequin cover girls painted in the early &rsquo;60s by Maio from his own collection to the album mastering by Abbey Road&rsquo;s Sean Magee, best known for his nuanced remastering of The Beatles&rsquo; and John Lennon&rsquo;s catalogs.<br \/> &ldquo;Because of the generosity of the people who contributed, I wanted to make sure that everything on the record was really good and solid,&rdquo; Matthew says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been waiting for it for a long time, and I feel like I owe it to them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Matthew&rsquo;s reward to those donors who were originally promised a set of demos (as it turned out, he didn&rsquo;t cut any) is Tomorrow&rsquo;s Daughter, a 12-song LP culled from the sessions; longtime fans will draw parallels between this limited-edition satellite record, as he describes it, and the previous companion pieces Goodfriend and Son of Altered Beast. When that one arrives, 29 of the 38 songs will be in circulation.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew doesn&rsquo;t know where this flood of inspiration came from, but he has an inkling. &ldquo;Maybe it came from being in a new place, getting to recreate my studio here,&rdquo; he speculates. &ldquo;Also, I feel connected to being here in a way that I haven&rsquo;t felt before&mdash;the feeling of having two feet on solid ground. But having said all that, after my mother died, I couldn&rsquo;t even think about writing songs or starting to record for months and months. And in the end, I&rsquo;m pleased, because I feel like I do get close to dealing with my feelings about her death at certain spots on the record. So that does inform it, but at the same time it doesn&rsquo;t completely overtake it being a rock &amp; roll record, or enjoyable rather than purely depressing. I had a lot of feelings about her death, and dying, but then I just sat down and wrote a bunch of songs. Some of them are connected to emotional stuff for me, obviously, because the songs aren&rsquo;t devoid of feeling.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s an understatement. &ldquo;Haunted&rdquo; is laced with mortal dread, while &ldquo;You Knew Me&rdquo; digs deep into the complicated nature of blood ties, concluding with a hard-earned epiphany: &ldquo;You knew me\/I knew you too\/Afraid of yourself\/Afraid of me\/Afraid of myself\/Afraid of you.&rdquo; The penultimate &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; ponders the possible existence of multiple universes and parallel dimensions, opening into the climactic &ldquo;End Is Near,&rdquo; which closes the album on a note of unvarnished directness and gut-punch poignancy. A thorny contemplation of the finality of life, the song burrows down to the raw nub of the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had a lot of different feelings, but I didn&rsquo;t necessarily sit down to write a song about this feeling and that feeling,&rdquo; Matthew recalls. &ldquo;I just wrote batches of songs, and then it became clear what they might be about. For as long as it took to make the record, I didn&rsquo;t agonize over writing, or rewrite songs; it was all quick and mysterious, like always. It&rsquo;s just that I was dealing with moving for the first time in 20 years, and dealing with my mom&mdash;just the shock of it all in general was what made it take as long as it did. What I mean is, I don&rsquo;t think any of it was overwrought; most everything is just the first thing anyone played.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>When an uncommonly gifted artist trusts and follows the lead of his intuition, the results can be magical. In terms of its musical density, thematic depth, emotional immediacy and sheer scale, Tomorrow Forever could be described as Matthew Sweet&rsquo;s All Things Must Pass. That wasn&rsquo;t the plan&mdash;there was no plan. It just turned out that way.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Right after we moved here,&rdquo; says Matthew, &ldquo;I made this video for Kickstarter, and in it, if anything, I was promising myself that I was going to make a really heartfelt record.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Mission accomplished.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MatthewSweet_2_00_36_PM_3_15_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 28 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 28","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/iammatthewsweet"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/officialmatthewsweet\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2idymNTKUdnTxforkb12Mw"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iammatthewsweet"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.matthewsweet.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC5yvMCwmHF3S_fLi6F8G8og"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:28 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"walker-hayes":{"id":"3866","name":"Walker Hayes","friendly_url":"walker-hayes","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p><em>boom<\/em>. Walker Hayes uses the word often. &ldquo;It just felt right,&rdquo; the breakout country singer says of the title for his highly-anticipated new album. It&rsquo;s a celebratory sort of thing, he&rsquo;ll tell you. A new radio station adds his buzzing single, &ldquo;You Broke Up With Me.&rdquo; <em>boom<\/em>. He links up for a national tour with Thomas Rhett. <em>boom<\/em>. That rowdy performance at CMA Fest &ndash;the one that had the crowd singing every word of his music back to him? <em>boom. <\/em>It wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Not by a long shot. Lately, though, Hayes has had occasion to bust out the word often. And he&rsquo;s not complaining.<\/p>\n<p>A confessional, no-nonsense singer-songwriter, and one whose voice and perspective brims with relatability, Hayes is a tried-and-true Nashville standout. He&rsquo;s an original in a town all-too-often rife with mimicry and compromise. And, now, he has audiences flocking to him in a major way. Conversational, honest and real in song, Hayes&rsquo; forthcoming debut album is the voice of a grinder laying it bare. It&rsquo;s the stories of a man who realized the songs he couldn&rsquo;t help but write &mdash; about family, struggle, vices and the sacrifices we make for a dream &mdash; were his and his alone. &ldquo;It startles some people. Like, &lsquo;Wow, he&rsquo;s really putting out there,&rsquo;&rdquo; Hayes says of the raw songwriting that characterizes <em>boom<\/em>. and last year&rsquo;s two break-out <em>8 Tracks <\/em>releases. &ldquo;But, that&rsquo;s what my heroes did,&rdquo; he says referencing the Willie&rsquo;s and Waylon&rsquo;s and Merle&rsquo;s of the world. &ldquo;I can only write something if I truly feel it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And if the Mobile, Alabama native has learned anything over more than a decade spent in Nashville, it&rsquo;s that he can <em>only <\/em>be himself. His music &mdash; from the unflinching and honest &ldquo;Beer in the Fridge,&rdquo; to the spare and tender love song &ldquo;Beautiful,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; <em>boom.<\/em>&rsquo;s gripping album closer that documents a friend who came to his family&rsquo;s aid in a time of need &mdash; is entirely Hayes&rsquo; own, even if it&rsquo;s not always pretty. Hayes knows only he can sing, or yes, sometimes rap his songs. Nothing thrills him more than having no rules and no restriction on his creativity. &ldquo;As an artist that was so freeing,&rdquo; he says of the flexibility from his label, the recently revamped Monument Records, to be his own man. &ldquo;That was like somebody telling you to write for no other reason than to just write,&rdquo; he says alluding to the freedom to pen attention-getting songs like &ldquo;Shut Up Kenny,&rdquo; his ode to songs like Kenny Chesney&rsquo;s on the radio that can immediately snap you back into <em>those <\/em>memories. &ldquo;No one was saying, &lsquo;Your song has to go on this radio station.&rsquo; They just said, &lsquo;Go, do what you love and love doing it every day.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>He&rsquo;d long had it drilled into his head that there existed finite rules that comprised a successful country song. So, Hayes is the first to admit it caught him off guard when listeners responded so passionately to the personal music he was writing. The singer says that, in time, he realized simply, &ldquo;people want to hear the nitty gritty of life and the honesty and the authenticity. Just because there is something that typically works on radio right now doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s not listeners out there that are craving that personal experience that they can relate to.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I didn&rsquo;t settle for anything but the one-hundred percent truth in a song,&rdquo; Hayes continues, &ldquo;listeners were intrigued the most.&rdquo; This father of six, who moved to Nashville on a hunch 12 years ago and for years and struggled to make it work, relishes his current moment. He&rsquo;d been dropped from multiple record labels and admits there was a time he wondered how he&rsquo;d feed his growing family. Not until he began peeling back the layers to his own life and subsequently documenting it in song did everything fall into place. &ldquo;A song should move people like a conversation but be prettier and more memorable,&rdquo; Hayes says of his current attitude toward songwriting. &ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s just therapeutic to write.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hayes has always been the type that had to be cajoled into doing what always came natural to him. The son of a real estate broker, Hayes loved music &mdash; piano recitals, noodling on his guitar &mdash; but figured he&rsquo;d stick around home and log a normal 9-5. However, after constant needling from his father, Hayes finally agreed to perform at a local bar, if only to get dad off his back. It was a tiny stage, he remembers with a laugh &mdash; &ldquo;a small crowd, but there was applause after my songs&rdquo; &mdash; and it felt incredible. &ldquo;For some reason, when I left that show that night I knew right then that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do,&rdquo; Hayes recalls. He called his wife, asked her if she wanted to move to Nashville, and she said yes without hesitation.<\/p>\n<p>He instantly fell in love with songwriting, landed a job with a publishing company, and even got a record deal but, things in Nashville aren&rsquo;t as easy as they seem and soon Hayes&rsquo; deals fell through. For years he grinded it out: writing songs for other artists where he could, working odd jobs to pay the bills, lying in bed at night trying to convince himself to not love writing songs anymore &ldquo;because all it does is mess me up. It makes a fool of me. It strings me through all this up and down and eventually breaks my heart.&rdquo; But, of course, he&rsquo;d wake up the next day and want nothing more than to write another song.<\/p>\n<p>In due-time he linked up with ace songwriter and GRAMMY award-winning producer Shane McAnally who signed Hayes to his SMACKSongs publishing company and soon released two volumes of Hayes&rsquo; music for free online &mdash; <em>8 Tracks, Vol. 1: Good Shit <\/em>and <em>8 Tracks, Vol. 2: Break the Internet<\/em>. As if without warning, the music quickly attracted a massive swell of popularity.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when you almost lose that you really realize that maybe you were born to do this no matter what,&rdquo; Hayes says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about success or anything &mdash; it&rsquo;s where you belong.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>And now, with <em>boom.<\/em>, Hayes is ready to pull back the curtain entirely and give all of himself to his music, his fans, his family &ndash;everyone who has stuck with him on this long and sometimes painful journey.<\/p>\n<p>Just like his songs, Hayes&rsquo; live show is completely inimitable. Having long played showcases in the round &mdash; ones where he&rsquo;d sit on a barstool and tell stories before performing a tune; he now distinguishes his shows using a loop, he beatboxes, and he incorporates a backing band of musicians into the mix. &ldquo;The show is growing on a weekly basis,&rdquo; Hayes says. &ldquo;When a crowd is so electric that you can feed off their energy you feel kind of invincible up there. It is amazing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Hayes isn&rsquo;t one to predict what comes next. All he&rsquo;ll tell you is that he&rsquo;ll be heeding his own advice because, hey, if nothing else, it&rsquo;s gotten him to this point. &ldquo;I started just trusting what felt right and what moved me and a lot of special songs came out,&rdquo; he says of <em>boom<\/em>. For Hayes, then, going forward the process remains the same. Says the singer of the road ahead: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to continue finding out who exactly I am.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WalkerHayes_11_59_10_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"June 27 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"June 27","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/walkerhayes"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/walkerhayes\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7sKxqpSqbIzphAKAhrqvlf"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/walkerhayes"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/walkerhayes.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UClTsgdWILdO5vVN0w4j2x1g"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:06 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"savannah-conley":{"id":"3982","name":"Savannah Conley","friendly_url":"savannah-conley","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-08","long_dates":"July 8","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 8","description":"<p>Emerging singer-songwriter Savannah Conley will release her new EP on February 16.

That&rsquo;s exactly what happened in the case of Cleveland rock band Welshly Arms.<\/p>\n<p>On the breakout single &ldquo;Legendary,&rdquo; lead singer and guitarist Sam Getz belts, <em>&ldquo;Cuz we&rsquo;re gonna be legends, gonna get their attention.&rdquo;<\/em> Breathing life into those words, this anthem captured the globe&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;attention&rdquo;<\/em> in 2017. Initially igniting Germany after its independent release, the song quietly spread like wildfire across countless influential Spotify playlists, cracking 34 million streams and 1.25 million Shazam&rsquo;s in under six months. Earning their first watershed moment, &ldquo;Legendary&rdquo; resulted from years of tireless work by the six-piece&mdash;Getz, Brett Lindemann [keyboard, vocals], Jimmy Weaver [bass, vocals], Mikey Gould [drums], Bri Bryant [vocals], and Jon Bryant [vocals].<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about how there&rsquo;s a payoff to all of that effort,&rdquo; admits Getz. &ldquo;In the beginning, it was inspired by Lebron James. He&rsquo;s from the Cleveland area, and he ended up on our team. He always goes hard. That idea extends to music. The six of us leave everything on the court. We ignore the doubters, naysayers, and obstacles and just keep fighting.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That fighting spirit came to life at a Sunday barbecue back in 2013. The frontman had taken a break from the road and invited his future bandmates over for some beers and burgers. Sooner rather than later, they found themselves jamming in the basement. A regular Sunday jam morphed into a band whose sound blends Soul, Blues, Rock, and Gospel. They recorded the <em>Welcome <\/em>EP in 2013 followed by the <em>Covers<\/em> EP a year later and 2015&rsquo;s full-length <em>Welshly Arms<\/em>. Their music would soundtrack commercials and trailers for Miller Lite, Indian Motorcycles, <em>The Hateful Eight<\/em>, and NETFLIX&rsquo;s <em>Sense8<\/em> in addition to a campaign for some other hometown heroes: the Cleveland Indians.<\/p>\n<p>Along the way, they scorched stages at <em>SXSW, Austin City Limits<\/em><strong>,&nbsp;<\/strong><em>Laurel Live, Red Rocks,<\/em><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>and<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><em>Summerfest<\/em> and toured with the likes of NEEDTOBREATHE. Simultaneously, Welshly Arms honed a signature style by writing and producing every note themselves in their hometown HQ.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We always try to keep a gritty soul edge with everything we do,&rdquo; adds Getz. &ldquo;The vocals stick out, and the music is deep and raw. We take pride in producing all of the recordings ourselves. It&rsquo;s important to the sound.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Now, that sound comes to life on their <em>Legendary <\/em>EP [Republic Records]. A mosaic of influences, it translates Welshly Arms on stage energy into a collection of rousing, raucous, and real rock anthems.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope people notice what we put into this,&rdquo; Getz leaves off. &ldquo;With every gig, we want to put on a show and have fun with the audience. On the records, I hope you can hear our enjoyment in making music. I want everybody to share that when they hear it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The band is well on its way to being <em>legends<\/em>&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WelshlyArms_4_27_46_PM_4_4_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"June 30 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"June 30","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/welshlyarmsband\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/welshlyarms\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1xKrH6GSh9CJh8nYwbqW7B"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/welshlyarms"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/welshlyarms.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/WelshlyArmsBand"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/04\/2018 04:27:48 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-posies":{"id":"3803","name":"The Posies","friendly_url":"the-posies","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll has rarely been as smart, soulful or satisfying than it has in the hands of The Posies.

Hard as it was to continue without such a close friend and great musician, the moment called for a reinvention. For now&hellip; the idea of the band getting into a room and banging out the music, garage band style, was over. The ideas coming from Jon and Ken were fragile and the moods contemplative. Death, divorce, loss. Even the joys of life are fleeting enough as to be treated with care and respect.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the Posies still retain their legendary melodic abilities, their trademark vocal harmonies and their lyrical agility. The band has always been exploring, growing. The multi&shy;year gaps between albums are typically spent in countless other projects that bring new skills, sounds, experiences and people to the picture. The band will present the album live in a new format, incorporating laptop elements along with guitars, keyboards and drums. As artists, the band feels it&rsquo;s their duty to take risks and explore.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_PosiesThe_5_09_38_PM_3_13_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"June 28 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"June 28","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theposies\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/theposies"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5ZOh5D4MKLhU3GekPzNFam"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theposies"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/theposies.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ThePosiesVEVO"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:21 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"lit":{"id":"3975","name":"Lit","friendly_url":"lit","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>A major player throughout the post-grunge boom of the late '90s, Lit featured the combined talents of frontman A. Jay Popoff, his guitar-playing brother Jeremy, bassist Kevin Baldes, and drummer Allen Shellenberger. The group formed in 1990 in Orange County, California, where it initially performed metal-influenced music under the name Razzle. After changing their name, Lit began embracing a spunky brand of punk-pop that helped attract a local following in California. The group sold out local venues (including Club 369 in Fullerton) and issued two recordings: an EP, Five Smokin' Tracks from Lit; and the full-length Tripping the Light Fantastic, which arrived during the spring of 1997 and became a college radio hit.<\/p>\n<p>Lit then landed a contract with RCA Records, which released the follow-up effort A Place in the Sun two years later. This proved to be Lit's breakthrough record, as the catchy rock riffs of \"My Own Worst Enemy,\" \"Zip-Lock,\" and \"Miserable\" all paved the way for platinum sales. With \"My Own Worst Enemy\" topping the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart, Lit toured the country alongside groups like the Offspring, No Doubt, and Garbage. Furthermore, they performed a set at Woodstock 1999 and earned a spot on the 2000 Vans Warped Tour.<\/p>\n<p>A third album, Atomic, was released in fall 2001, spawning several singles including \"Lipstick and Bruises.\" A self-titled album arrived in 2004, marking Lit's fourth full-length effort (as well as their first release on the Nitrus label). In 2008, drummer Shellenberger was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He died on August 13, 2009 at the age of 39. Nathan Walker was added as the band's drummer and Lit began work on new material. In 2012, Lit released their fifth studio album, the Butch Walker-produced The View from the Bottom. They dedicated the album to Shellenberger.<\/p>\n<p>Lit has been actively touring, writing, and recording. They&rsquo;ve immersed themselves in Nashville&rsquo;s country music world with frequent writing trips, continuing to further their friendships with some of the biggest names in Country and Rock. The new sound of Lit shows a natural progression into a genre they&rsquo;ve always been connected to. It&rsquo;s one of the many examples of artists taking risks, as the lines that used to define them get blurrier by the day.<\/p>\n<p>THE LATEST:<br \/>Lit just wrapped a 30+ city North American Summer Tour, a chunk of which is part of Summerland Tour with Sugar Ray, Everclear, and Sponge. The tours showcased a new and buzz-worthy sonic direction for Lit into the Country realm. As Nashville SONY\/ATV writers, Jeremy Popoff and his frontman brother A. Jay have immersed themselves in the Country music world with constant songwriting trips, continuing to further their friendships - both on and off the stage - with some of the biggest names in Country music. Lit recently joined Dustin Lynch at Stagecoach Festival to deliver \"My Own Worst Enemy\" to over 50,000 of Country's most dedicated fans. The new sound of Lit shows a natural progression into a genre they&rsquo;ve long been connected to. Their brand new music video for the song \"Fast\" will be debuted by CMT on Oct 26th.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Lit_11_06_27_AM_3_30_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 28 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 28","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LitLounge\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/litbandofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5mgr0FFpvy267wKVAYg8qp"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LitBandOfficial"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.litmerchandise.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:19:43 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-james-hunter-six":{"id":"3778","name":"The James Hunter Six","friendly_url":"the-james-hunter-six","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p>It's been 10 years since the Englishman James Hunter burst onto the scene with his U.S. debut People Gonna Talk (GO\/Rounder 2006), topping the Billboard Blues chart, earning a Grammy-nomination, and attracting universal acclaim from critics and his fans -- including Van Morrison, Sharon Jones, and Allen Toussaint. Over the last decade, he's toured extensively around the world on the club, theatre, and festival circuits, steadily growing a dedicated audience comprised of hardened gig-goers, old-school baby boomers, and young hipsters alike. His follow-ups The Hard Way and Minute By Minute (GO\/Fantasy), further cemented Hunter's reputation as a soul powerhouse, heralded for his talents both as a live performer and perhaps even more so as a songwriter, with The New Yorker describing his \"tight, taut compositions\" as \"rooted in American soul music without being bound to it.\"<\/p>\n<p>Now Hunter is back with his fourth album, Hold On! marking his debut on Daptone Records, America's premier soul imprint and Hunter's second collaboration with famed producer Gabriel Roth aka Bosco Mann. It also marks a cumulative and consecutive total of 48 original songs written exclusively by Hunter, without resorting to a single covered recording. At age 53, Hunter feels he has finally found his home for making music. \"The great thing about working with Gabe is that he can get our tunes on tape exactly the way I heard them in my head when I was writing them,\" explained Hunter. \"It's a rare thing when a producer knows what you're going for before you've told him. It's good to be associated with a record company that 'gets' us.\"<\/p>\n<p>And the feeling is mutual. From Roth's perspective, \"In today's R&amp;B world, littered with retro-soul cronies, ear-twisting melisma, and hollow affectations, James has a voice that stands out not only for its natural beauty and grit, but for its honesty. His songwriting shares the masterful architecture and the inspired creativity of Smokey Robinson, each rhyme and rhythm crafted meticulously, somehow twisting familiar themes into unfamiliar new shapes.\"<\/p>\n<p>In May 2015, James and his longtime trusted bandmates (Jonathan Lee, drums; Lee Badau, baritone saxophone; Damian Hand, tenor saxophone; Andrew Kingslow, keyboards\/percussion; Jason Wilson, bass) returned to the Roth's Penrose Recorders in Riverside, California (AKA Daptone West) to cut Hold On! live to 8-track tape.<\/p>\n<p>Though tunes like \"(Baby) Hold On,\" \"If That Don't Tell You,\" and \"Stranded\" carry the buoyant energy, crackerjack arrangements, and tough soulful pulse for which the band has become renown, the true treasures of this LP may lie in the deeper grooves. Rumbas, boleros, bossanovas, and easy rockers, each one swinging more than the last: \"This Is Where We Came In,\" \"Something's Calling,\" \"A Truer Heart,\" \"Light of My Life,\" \"In The Dark\" -- no clich&eacute;d throwback nods to a-time-gone-by here. These are forever songs crafted with immaculate care and ingenuity and sang with an effortless balance of tenderness and grit. The word \"authentic\" will be bandied about this album, but it really has no place here. Hunter's words are truly his own and though at moments his voice may \"evoke\" Ray Charles or Sam Cooke, there lies an inherent naturalness in these songs that bucks any comparison past or present.<\/p>\n<p>James Hunter was born Neil James Huntsman in Colchester, Essex in October 1962. He left school at 16 to work mending signal boxes on the railways. Introduced to rock'n'roll and rhythm'n'blues via his grandmother's collection of old 78s, he quickly fell in love with the genre and began to develop his sound as a teenager. His first experience of playing live didn't occur until he was 22, when his group performed at Colchester Labour club (\"we were dreadful\"), but his career swiftly started swinging as powerfully and jubilantly as his music. Adopting the moniker Howlin' Wilf in honour of one of his biggest inspirations, in 1986 he cut an album titled 'Cry Wilf' for the independent Big Beat label with backing band The Vee-jays. Early the following year, he enjoyed his big break when the band made an appearance on Channel 4's Friday teatime music show The Tube.<\/p>\n<p>Howlin' Wilf &amp; The Vee-Jays became a popular fixture on the UK club circuit, and in the early '90s they caught the eye of Van Morrison, who asked them to back him at the Belfast Telegraph Awards in 1991. Subsequently, Hunter was invited to sing backing vocals with Morrison's touring band -- he appears on 1994's A Night In San Francisco live CD and on 1995's studio album 'Days Like This.' Returning the compliment, the Belfast soul man sings on Hunter's 1996 album Believe What I Say.<\/p>\n<p>By the early 2000s, however, Hunter found himself down on his luck and working as a labourer in west London but soon realised it was more lucrative and better fun to earn a living busking. The low point came when a homeless female squatted down and relieved herself in front of him while he performed in the street (\"Everyone's a critic!\"). Slowly pulling himself out of this slough of despond, with his trusted Six he cut the album that would ignite his career -- 2006's People Gonna Talk, and relaunch his career.<\/p>\n<p>In the decade since, Hunter has worked tirelessly on the road and in the studio, honing is craft. However Hold On! is something deeper than just another notch in his belt. From the driving stompers, to the bubbling rumbas, the record drips with the rawness and feeling that Daptone fans have become accustomed to, and cuts straight to the soul of the man who James Hunter fans have come to love. It is truly an artist's vision come to fruition.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JamesHunterSixThe_10_44_22_AM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 7 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 7","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheJamesHunterSix"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jameshuntermusic.com\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":""},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4WM7072AVxYse8jthvfKAY"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rJTEhzl66sE"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:18:55 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"molly-hatchet":{"id":"3893","name":"Molly Hatchet","friendly_url":"molly-hatchet","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-07","long_dates":"July 7","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, July 7","description":"<p>In the early 1970s a new form of music was emerging in the South. A mixture of blues, country, gospel and the English invasion of rock and roll that later was to be coined the phrase \"Southern Rock.\" The music was filled with style and emotion and with bands in the forefront such as the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd and a band from Jacksonville, Florida called Molly Hatchet. Named after a famous 17th century axe murderess \"hatchet molly\" who would behead her lovers with the hand tool Lizzy Borden made famous. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Their self-titled debut album which included Danny Joe Brown, Dave Hlubek, Duane Roland, Steve Holland, Banner Thomas and Bruce Crump in the lineup was released on Epic records in 1978 and reached multi-platinum status as the band established their reputation of working hard, playing tough and living fast through intense touring with such bands as Aerosmith, Bob Seger, The Rolling Stones and many more. In 1979, Flirtin' With Disaster was released and history was in the making. The band continued touring on the road with an average of 250 live shows per year and like the first album it also achieved multi-platinum status. Lead singer, Danny Joe Brown left the band in 1980 and contacted Bobby Ingram, a Jacksonville based guitarist and friend, who gave brown his first singing gig in 1975 with a Jacksonville based band called Rum Creek. Brown and Ingram then put together with keyboardist John Galvin the Danny Joe Brown Band and continued touring until 1982. The album was produced by Glyn Johns at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas as he has worked with legendary artist The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, The Eagles and many more<\/p>\n<p>During this time, Beatin' The Odds (1980) and Take No Prisoners (1981) was released with singer Jimmy Farrar. Brown returned to record No Guts ... No Glory (1983), The Deed Is Done (1984) and Double Trouble Live (1985).In the fall of 1985, Bobby Ingram of Jacksonville came into the band as lead guitar and songwriter and the band continued to tour over 200 dates a year and in 1989 record Lightning Strikes Twice for capitol records.<\/p>\n<p>In 1990, while Ingram, Galvin and Brown continued the tradition as Molly Hatchet the tough touring schedule lead to the other members departure from the band. The Greatest Hits album was released in 1991 and certified gold. The band from 1990 until 1995 took a break from recording but continued to write new songs and tour in the United States, Canada and Europe. Devil's Canyon, the first studio album in 6 years was then recorded in Hamburg, Germany in 1996 under the care and guidance of Rainer Hansel, CBH Records. With producers Kalle Trapp and Bobby Ingram the album was voted the number one rock record in Europe for 1996. With a history of diabetes, brown was unable to fulfill studio and touring responsibilities and he brought in Phil McCormack to take over the lead vocal position. Long time member Bobby Ingram - lead guitar, Phil McCormack - lead vocals, John Galvin - keyboards, Bryan Bassett - lead guitar, Andy McKinney - bass, Mac Crawford - drums, make up the current lineup.<\/p>\n<p>From the release of Devil's Cannon and the world wide touring coordinated by Steve Green, Artists International Management, the band has continued performing the classic hits such as \"Flirtin' With Disaster, \"Gator Country,\" \"Whiskey Man\" and \"Dreams I'll Never Dee,\" as well as, the current hits in the true spirit and southern tradition of Molly Hatchet. The 1998 release of Silent Reign Of Heroes was recorded back in Hamburg, Germany with producer\/guitarist Bobby Ingram and is kept in the same spirit and tradition as the past with new hit songs \"Mississippi Moon Dog,\" \"Saddle Tramp,\" \"Miss Saturday Night\" and the title track \"Silent Reign Of Heroes\". Included on the album is an acoustic version of the classic hit \"Fall Of The Peacemakers\". The band is currently on an extensive 18 month world tour in support of the new release \"Kingdom of XII\" where guest artist Charlie Daniels appeared on 2 tracks the album charted in Europe and had much success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2003 the band is celebrating it's 25th anniversary of the first national or international release with first a double Live album \"Locked and Loaded\" recorded in Germany as they consider this their home away from home and it is the first time in 7 years that a Live album has made the European Charts and SPV GmbH is still there beloved record company with Rainer Hansel and Manfred Schutz.&nbsp; The band has plans on touring in support of the 25th anniversary and will release a new studio album of all of the classic songs re-recorded in this generation of the band with Artists International Management, Inc. as their agency. And Locked and Loaded a double CD that was recorded in Germany at the International Harley Davidson Festival in front of 80,000 Southern rockers that has now been captured on DVD and being released fall of 2005. After 4.5 years of touring and tracking outside of the studio on their own material it was time to release an album that in the bands tradition go back to the roots of straight forward southern rock and roll that's unequaled of anything the band has recorded before in the 25 year legacy. The album \"Warriors of the Rainbow Bridge\" recorded in the mountain tops of Bavaria was the perfect setting for such a comprehensive project. As we live day by day no one knew that Bobby Ingram would suffer the lose of his wife Stephanie during the tracking of the album and finish after a delay. Stephanie was the seventh member of Molly Hatchet and she did many things behind the scenes that no one ever saw and she was never the person that would ever want anything in return. The Southern Rock community has lost a great person that she gave all and loved Molly Hatchet and the friends she made along the way. If that was the first emotional heartbreak, Danny Joe Brown the singer for Molly Hatchet passed away from complications of diabetes he had suffered with for many years and he gave so much to the rock and roll industry and music around the world all of our heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to his family and children and he also will never be forgotten. In 2006, Duane Roland, guitarist of the band passed away and also left a legacy that will never be forgotten. We will all miss him and his music lives on. In 2005, Dave Hlubek, a founding member after playing in various bands around the United States has returned to Molly Hatchet after 20 years. Everyone was glad to see Dave having a good time and doing what he does best...the tradition lives on!! &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So as we enter the next 25 years of music Molly Hatchet supports tradition that keeps developing the common bond and unity that keeps this style of music alive and well and rest assured Molly Hatchet is a band that after 28 years is always workin' hard, playin' tough, livin' fast, and still Flirtin' with Disaster!!!<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MollyHatchet_12_32_49_AM_3_26_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 7 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 7","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Official-Molly-Hatchet-815255768543314\/?ref=page_internal"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4ZqBwBVB3dsYWL3d5Spi10"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mollyhatchet"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/mollyhatchet.com\/MollyHatchet\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:42 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"drivin-n-cryin":{"id":"3734","name":"Drivin N Cryin","friendly_url":"drivin-n-cryin","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Celebrating their 32nd Anniversary together, Atlanta-based folk rock act, Drivin N Cryin, have spent most of 2017 on tour. In October 1985 Drivin N Cryin played their first show at Atlanta&rsquo;s famed 688 Club. The band quickly gained attention for its blistering live shows and amassed a rabid fanbase in the fertile soil of the late-1980s Southeast music scene.Now, 32 years later and releasing four full length albums on Island Records and one on Geffen Records founding members Kevn Kinney and Tim Nielsen find themselves enjoying a milestone anniversary for the band, having survived the pressures of fame, a shifting musical landscape, multiple lineup changes, and miles of backroads and highways to arrive here.<\/p>\n<p>With a gold record, 10 full-length albums, and a handful of EPs to their credit, the band still refuses to rest. In 2012, a documentary about the band entitled Scarred but Smarter: Life n Times of Drivin' N&rsquo; Cryin' was produced. In 2015, a collection of 10 choice cuts from the band&rsquo;s 4-EP &ldquo;Songs&rdquo; series, entitled Best of Songs, was released on Nashville&rsquo;s Plowboy Records. Additionally, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame the same year. The following year, Drivin N Cryin released a vinyl-only album, entitled Archives Vol One, with a collection of basement recordings from the years 1988 to 1990.<\/p>\n<p>With Dave V. Johnson as their drummer and the band's newest member Laur Joamets (originally Sturgill Simpson) now being added to the lineup, Drivin N Cryin is continuing to tour the U.S. to great acclaim.<\/p>\n<p>Island Records will be re-releasing their acclaimed record &ldquo;Mystery Road&rdquo; through Universal Music Group later this year. Darius Rucker has cut &ldquo;Straight to Hell&rdquo; on his new album slated for this October with guest vocals appearances of Luke Bryan, Charles Kelley and Jason Aldean.<\/p>\n<p>A quote from the band&rsquo;s lead singer, Kevn Kinney, gives a little insight into what Drivin N Cryin is all about: &ldquo;We are a band that's like your record collection.&rdquo; Drawing influence from a wide array of musical elements, Drivin N Cryin has developed a unique sound over the years. Their name derives from the eclectic nature of this sound: a little drivin' rock n roll and a little country twang. Comfortable with their past and confident in their future, the band has an arsenal of songs, a full tank of gas, and no plans of stopping any time soon.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DrivinNCryin_11_16_35_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/drivinncryin\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/drivinncryin\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/26yYgoh7hehqYix76g3LcS"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/drivinncryin?lang=en"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.drivinncryin.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/drivinncryinATL"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:35 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"meat-puppets":{"id":"3732","name":"Meat Puppets","friendly_url":"meat-puppets","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Original.

But things are really picking up now, and things are rolling like crazy.\"<\/p>\n<p>The 12-song Step Into Light, on the band's own 33 1\/3 label, embodies all of the qualities that have endeared Fastball to listeners during the trio's twenty-year-plus career. Such catchy, compelling new tunes as \"We're On Our Way,\" \"Behind The Sun,\" \"Best Friend,\" \"Love Comes In Waves\" and \"I Will Never Let You Down\" continue the band's longstanding legacy of infectious songcraft and pointed lyrics, as well as playfully inventive arrangements that lend additional depth and resonance to Scalzo and Miles Zuniga's distinctive songwriting.<\/p>\n<p>\"My favorite kind of songs,\" Zuniga says, \"are the ones that have hope in the face of hopelessness. Songs that say 'Life sucks and everything's against me, but I'm gonna smile and survive anyway.'&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the essence of rock 'n' roll music for me, and I think there's a fair amount of that on this album.\"<\/p>\n<p>Fastball recorded Step Into Light in its hometown of Austin, Texas, with the three bandmates co-producing with longtime friend Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith (Slayer, Meat Puppets, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead) at Smith's studio, The Bubble. The album was mixed by legendary engineer Bob Clearmountain, who also handled mixing duties on two prior Fastball albums.<\/p>\n<p>\"We consciously decided to make this record in a short period of time, so we just went in and knocked it out,\" Zuniga explains. \"I really liked working that way, and I think the fact that we recorded it in under two weeks made it a better record. We didn't have the luxury of getting too precious about things, so we gave ourselves a hard deadline and pretended it was the 1950s&mdash;the record light's on, let's do it! It also helped that we've grown a lot as musicians, so we have the ability now to get things right pretty quickly.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"We had a great time making this record,\" asserts Shuffield. \"Working fast was really positive for us, because we had a lot of adrenaline going and there was no wasted time. A lot of the stuff we did was one or two takes of all three of us playing together in the same room. You can't really do that as a new band, but the fact that we've been together so long creates a certain unspoken communication that saves a lot of time.\"<\/p>\n<p>The resulting album extends and expands Fastball's widely-loved body of work, which encompasses such acclaimed albums as the band's 1996 debut Make Your Mama Proud, their 1998 platinum breakthrough All the Pain Money Can Buy (which spawned the Grammy-nominated Top Five hit \"The Way\"), 2000's The Harsh Light of Day, 2004's Keep Your Wig On and 2009's Little White Lies.<\/p>\n<p>While it's a natural musical successor to the band's prior work, the self-financed, self-released Step Into Light&mdash;the first Fastball album to get a vinyl LP release&mdash;also continues Fastball's seamless evolution into a resourceful, self-contained D.I.Y. combo.<\/p>\n<p>\"We were one of the last bands who got to go into a big studio with a major-label budget, with runners and assistant engineers and cool rented gear,\" Scalzo notes. \"We were fortunate to have that, because it was a great learning experience and it taught us to be producers. There's a time when you're the big new thing and everyone loves you, and then there's a time when nobody's returning your phone calls. We're lucky that we survived that and came out on the other end, and we're a stronger and better band because of that.\"<\/p>\n<p>Step Into Light demonstrates that Fastball's collective creative rapport, forged over two decades of writing, recording and touring, remains as potent as ever. \"There's nothing more satisfying than being in a room with those guys and making it sound like a Fastball song,\" Shuffield says. \"That chemistry has always been there, from the very first time we played together. Our history, and the musical journey that we've been on together&mdash;all that stuff comes out when we play together.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"The three of us all have our own individual preferences and baggage and whatnot, but there's a certain sound that comes out when the three of us play together that we can't get anywhere else,\" Zuniga adds. \"We never have to worry about it, it's just always there, and it's been there from the beginning.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"We never really blew it,\" Scalzo says. \"We've had plenty of chances to embarrass ourselves and do some of the stupid things that bands do, but I don't think we ever have. Considering how long we've been together, that's a real achievement.\"<\/p>\n<p>Another continuing thread in Fastball's musical life is the band's loyal fan base, which has continued to support the band through thick and thin.<\/p>\n<p>\"I'm continually amazed,\" Shuffield says, \"that we'll play deep cuts and lesser-known songs, and people will know every single word to every song. It's extremely gratifying to know that you had that kind of effect on someone, and that the music you created resonates with them so strongly. Now it's become a generational thing; our original fans bring their kids to the shows, and then the kids become fans.\"<\/p>\n<p>With a beloved body of work under their collective belt and Step Into Light making it clear that their musical light still burns as brightly as ever, Fastball is entering a positive and productive period that promises all manner of musical riches.<\/p>\n<p>\"When I was younger, there were all sorts of ulterior motives for being in a band,\" Zuniga reflects. \"It wasn't just music, it was all the vices that go with being in a rock band. But I'm not concerned with any of the other stuff anymore; I just want to make good music. I think that we're all enjoying the band more than we ever have. We're in a really good spot right now, and we just want to make as much music as we can, while we can.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"We're really excited to get out there and play this new material,\" concludes Shuffield. \"It's a blessing to have been doing this for so long and still having new music to play, and we're thrilled to be able to keep doing this.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Fastball_11_20_49_AM_3_16_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 1 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 1","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fastballtheband\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/fastballtheband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7FtVJzRtpQpU61nBwB7cKN"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/FASTBALLTHEBAND"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.fastballtheband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC3EMWd1XsvVhf3hn2f4LguQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:13 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"roger-clyne--the-peacemakers":{"id":"3782","name":"Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers","friendly_url":"roger-clyne--the-peacemakers","stages":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>Hailed as one of the most exciting live acts on the road today, Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers are musical beacons of the Southwest fueled by witty and insightful lyrics, crunching guitar riffs, a dynamic rhythm section and tequila. RCPM are the only act to release seven consecutive studio albums to land on the top 10 of Billboard&rsquo;s Internet Sales Chart, two at No. 1, all released on a 100% independent record label.<\/p>\n<p>Dubbed the &ldquo;Springsteen of the Southwest&rdquo; by the Asbury Park Press, Roger Clyne and his guitar have toured around the world over his 20-year career, starting with The Refreshments. The seminal Tempe, Arizona band made big waves in the &rsquo;90s both on college and alternative rock radio as well as MTV with the songs &ldquo;Banditos&rdquo; (with the infamous chorus, &ldquo;Everybody knows that the world is full of stupid people&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Down Together&rdquo; as well as writing the theme for TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;King of the Hill.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>More than 20 years later, Clyne and Refreshments drummer PH Naffah, along with bassist Nick Scropos and lead guitarist Jim Dalton keep the songs of The Refreshments alive, while adding to their own ever growing musical legacy. RCPM&rsquo;s new album, Native Heart, will be released on June 30th, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>A testament to their growing and extremely loyal fan base is the band&rsquo;s annual music festival in Rocky Point, Mexico, called Circus Mexicus. What began as a rooftop show thrown together with extension cords and wooden pallets more than 15 years ago has blossomed into a pilgrimage that draws thousands of fans to the once sleepy fishing village. In 2014, fans from 43 states and 7 countries represented at Circus Mexicus.<\/p>\n<p>Clyne not only sings about life in the border-lands, he also produces his own private label top shelf tequila called Mexican Moonshine. From Gold medals in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition to Gold Ribbons from Tequila Aficionado&rsquo;s Brands of Promise, accolades have been rolling in. And a bottle of Mexican Moonshine Tequila made a well received &ldquo;guest appearance&rdquo; on the Rachel Ray Show.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016, Clyne&rsquo;s career came full circle as Roger Clyne &amp; The Peacemakers celebrated the 20th anniversary of The Refreshments cult classic debut album, &ldquo;Fizzy Fuzzy Big &amp; Buzzy,&rdquo; with a residency at the Yucca Tap Room in their hometown of Tempe, followed by a nationwide tour.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_RogerClyneThePeacemakers_12_57_00_AM_3_8_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Miller Lite Oasis Stage","date_time":"July 1 - 6:30 PM","stage_id":"miller-lite-oasis-stage","date":"July 1","start_time":"6:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rogerclyne\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/rogerclyneandthepeacemakers\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/3G3O90wIZmjYHTX2vgTVRM"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/azpeacemakers"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/rogerclyneandthepeacemakers.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/RCPMvids"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:58 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"a-flock-of-seagulls":{"id":"3809","name":"A Flock of Seagulls","friendly_url":"a-flock-of-seagulls","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>As well-known for their bizarrely teased haircuts as their hit single \"I Ran (So Far Away),\" A<br \/>Flock of Seagulls were one of the infamous one-hit wonders of the new wave era. Growing out of the synth-heavy and ruthlessly stylish new romantic movement, A Flock of Seagulls were a little too robotic and arrived a little too late to be true new romantics, but their sleek dance-pop was forever indebted to the short-lived movement. The group benefitted considerably from MTV's heavy rotation of the \"I Ran\" video in the summer of 1982.<\/p>\n<p>Hairdresser Mike Score (lead vocals, keyboards) formed A Flock of Seagulls with his brother Ali (drums) and fellow hairdresser Frank Maudsley (bass) in 1980, adding guitarist Paul Reynolds several months later. The group released its debut EP on Cocteau Records early in 1981, and while the record failed to chart, its lead track, \"Telecommunication,\" became an underground hit in Euro-disco and new wave clubs. The band signed a major-label contract with Jive by the end of the year, and their eponymous debut album appeared in the spring of 1982. \"I Ran (So Far Away)\" was released as the first single from the album, and MTV quickly picked up on its icily attractive video, which featured long shots of Mike Score and his distinctive, cascading hair. The single climbed into the American Top Ten, taking the album along with it. In the U.K., \"I Ran\" didn't make the Top 40, but \"Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)\" reached number ten later that year; in America, that single became a Top 40 hit in 1983, after \"Space Age Love Song\" peaked at number 30. \"Wishing\" was taken from the group's second album, Listen (1983), which was moderately successful.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>The band released 1984's The Story of a Young Heart failed to produce any hit singles but<br \/>Reynolds left after the album and was replaced by Gary Steadnin; the band also added<br \/>keyboardist Chris Chryssaphis. The new lineup was showcased on 1986's Dream Come True.<br \/>Shortly after its release, the band broke up. Mike Score assembled a new lineup of A Flock of Seagulls in 1989, releasing the single \"Magic\" and touring the U.S.A. The band continued to tour worldwide, although with major changes to its members, and in 1996 released a new album, The Light at the End of the World.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AFlockofSeagulls_1_26_03_PM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 1 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 1","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/myspace.com\/aflockofseagulls"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:25 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"cornerstone-of-rock":{"id":"3752","name":"Cornerstone of Rock","friendly_url":"cornerstone-of-rock","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-28","long_dates":"June 28","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, June 28","description":"<p>Featuring: THE IDES OF MARCH featuring JIM PETERIK, THE BUCKINGHAMS, CRYAN&rsquo; SHAMES, NEW COLONY SIX and SHADOWS OF KNIGHT<\/p>\n<p>--------<\/p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;Vintage&rdquo; has become ubiquitous. Traced to its origin, in wine culture, it refers to a specific time and place where a high-quality wine was born, but the word&rsquo;s use has expanded far beyond the cask, bottle and glass. In Music, for example. One of the greatest &ldquo;Vintages&rdquo; was 1965 to 1970 in Chicago, Illinois, where 5 groups wrote and recorded indelible hits that remain Gold standards all over the planet. The <strong>Buckinghams<\/strong>, the <strong>Cryan&rsquo; Shames<\/strong>, the <strong>Ides Of March<\/strong>, the <strong>Shadows of Knigh<\/strong>t and the <strong>New Colony Six<\/strong> each distilled the wide variety of emerging and classic styles of the era into unique voices as vibrant and diverse as the Windy City itself.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Cornerstones Of Rock<\/strong> show features the core members of these groups performing the songs first heard on <strong>WLS <\/strong>and<strong> WCFL<\/strong>, Chicago&rsquo;s powerhouse radio stations. The popularity of these tunes spread quickly throughout the U.S., becoming &ldquo;forever favorites&rdquo; for millions.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Buckinghams<\/strong>&rsquo; string of hits began in 1966 with &ldquo;Kind Of A Drag&rdquo;, followed closely by &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t You Care&rdquo;. Continuing with &ldquo;Mercy Mercy Mercy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hey Baby They&rsquo;re Playing Our Song&rdquo;, their Gold Record run earned the Bucks multiple national TV appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and American Bandstand. By the time &ldquo;Susan&rdquo; topped the charts, their legacy was secure. Original members <strong><em>CARL GIAMMARESE<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>NICK FORTUNA<\/em><\/strong> bring these hits and more to the Cornerstone Stage.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Cryan&rsquo; Shames<\/strong> cheerful 1966 debut &ldquo;Sugar And Spice&rdquo; was as infectious a pop nugget as could be, but beneath the confection, a deeper tone emerged. Adept at casting sophisticated arrangements as easy-to-dig pop songs, &ldquo;I Wanna Meet You&rdquo; and &ldquo;It Could Be We&rsquo;re In Love&rdquo; hit the spot for music lovers everywhere. When asked which version of her immortal &ldquo;Up On The Roof&rdquo; was her favorite, <em>Carole King<\/em> replied &ldquo;The Cryan&rsquo; Shames&rdquo;. Original members <strong><em>TOM &ldquo;TOAD&rdquo; DOODY<\/em><\/strong>, <strong><em>JIM &ldquo;J.C. HOOKE&rdquo; PILSTER<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>JAMES FAIRS<\/em><\/strong> perform together once again.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>New Colony Six<\/strong> embodied the free spirit of the day. Their early hits &ldquo;I Confess&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love You So Much&rdquo; bridged the gap between 50&rsquo;s-style Rock and British influence, filling dance floors immediately with every spin. Their next three blockbusters &ldquo;I Will Always Think About You&rdquo;, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t You See Me Cry&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Things I&rsquo;d Like To Say&rdquo; were heartfelt ballads 180&deg; from the early offerings. Their versatility is brought by Original Members <strong><em>RAY GRAFFIA, RONNIE RICE,<\/em><\/strong> and <strong><em>BRUCE MATTEY<\/em><\/strong> .<\/p>\n<p>A convincing argument can be made that Chicago&rsquo;s <strong>Shadows Of Knight<\/strong> is one of the progenitors of Punk and New Wave music, although no one called it that when the group debuted in 1965. If they never sang another note after their raw and rocking version of Van Morrison&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gloria&rdquo;, their place in Rock and Roll History would be assured, but the hits kept coming with rockers such as &ldquo;Shake&rdquo; and the bluesy &ldquo;Oh Yeah&rdquo;<strong>. <\/strong>The Shadow&rsquo;s one and only Frontman <strong><em>JIMY SOHNS<\/em><\/strong>&rsquo; energy has never diminished, clearly evident in his driving segment of the Cornerstones show.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Ides Of March<\/strong>, too, had a few different personalities throughout their long career. Their 1966 hit &ldquo;You Wouldn&rsquo;t Listen&rdquo; invoked the vocal styles heard in much of the R&amp;B music of the times, but by 1970, the band added Brass, and &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; became the fastest selling single in Warner Brother&rsquo;s History. Switching up again, 1971&rsquo;s &ldquo;L.A. Goodbye&rdquo; swapped out Brass swagger for sweet country vocal harmonies. The Ides are the Cornerstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;House Band&rdquo; and all four of the original Ides appear onstage: <strong><em>LARRY MILLAS, BOB BERGLAND, MIKE BORCH <\/em><\/strong>and <strong><em>JIM PETERIK.<\/em><\/strong> Jim&rsquo;s personal career has brought International Acclaim as a Grammy-winning, Oscar-nominated songwriter, performer and producer with millions of albums sold, such as &ldquo;The Eye Of The Tiger&rdquo; which Jim co-wrote for the film &ldquo;Rocky III&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>The Cornerstones Of Rock show is a living breathing slice of American Musical History performed by those who created it. Although this music is nearly a half century old, the songs and the Artists responsible for them are vital and at the top of their game. Great songs and great singers never go out of style; the continued demand for each of these bands in concert demonstrates that convincingly. To see and hear this stellar collection of talent in one show is a rare treat indeed.<\/p>\n<p>This is Rock and Roll Chicago-Style. And a fine, fine, vintage it is!<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CornerstoneofRock_10_32_03_AM_3_15_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Uline Warehouse Stage","date_time":"June 28 - 3:00 PM","stage_id":"uline-warehouse-stage","date":"June 28","start_time":"3:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IdesOfMarchUSA"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.theidesofmarch.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/TheIdesofMarchVideo"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/04\/2018 01:39:25 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"chris-lane":{"id":"3747","name":"Chris Lane","friendly_url":"chris-lane","stages":"uline-warehouse-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Since releasing the buzzy &ldquo;Fix,&rdquo; Lane racked up shout-outs from celebrities such as Brett Eldredge, Florida Georgia Line, Lucy Hale, Dustin Lynch, Cole Swindell, and more.

Raised in a strict, fundamentalist home, Vos lost everything when she and her family were expelled from the rural Wisconsin church where her father had long served as pastor. What happened next is the story of Dead Horses&rsquo; stunning new album, &lsquo;My Mother the Moon,&rdquo; a record full of trauma and triumph, despair and hope, pain and resilience.<\/p>\n<p>Blending elements of traditional roots with contemporary indie folk, the album is both familiar and unexpected, unflinchingly honest in its portrayal of modern American life, yet optimistic in its unshakable faith in brighter days to come. Earthy and organic, Vos&rsquo; songs often reveal themselves to be exercises in empathy and outreach; she writes not only to find meaning in the struggles she&rsquo;s endured, but also to embrace kindred souls on their own personal journeys of self-discovery. As much as the album is a reckoning with the past and everything she witnessed growing up (mental illness, poverty, addiction, and violence), it&rsquo;s also an effort to shape the future, to build a community based around art and love and beauty and acceptance, a community to replace the one she was so brusquely robbed of as a child.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;My Mother the Moon&rsquo; is Dead Horses&rsquo; third album, and it follows hot on the heels of their acclaimed 2016 release, &lsquo;Cartoon Moon,&rsquo; which&nbsp;<em>Wisconsin Public Radio<\/em>&nbsp;called &ldquo;equally beautiful and effortless.&rdquo; That record prompted the&nbsp;<em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel<\/em>&nbsp;to declare Dead Horses a Band To Watch and earned them honors for \"Best Album,\" \"Best Americana\/Bluegrass Artist,\" and \"Best Female Vocalist\"&nbsp;at the 2017 WAMI Awards.&nbsp;<em>American Songwriter<\/em>&nbsp;called Vos &ldquo;a compelling vocalist&hellip;who carries every tune with her husky, deeply emotional tone that feels lived in and real,&rdquo; while&nbsp;<em>No Depression&nbsp;<\/em>hailed her songwriting as &ldquo;beautiful and fresh.&rdquo; With a fleshed out touring lineup, the group logged countless miles, sharing bills along the way with Trampled by Turtles, Mandolin Orange, and Elephant Revival in addition to making festival appearances from Bristol Rhythm and Roots to WinterWonderGrass.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DeadHorses_1_37_28_PM_2_23_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Briggs & Stratton Big Backyard","date_time":"July 5 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"briggs--stratton-big-backyard","date":"July 5","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/deadhorseswi"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/deadhorseswi\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4dcU7cmzO3GECQGSKwl92z"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/deadhorseswi"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.deadhorses.net\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC2fmI0OIAfzQCEaCbpIjHXg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:33 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"wishbone-ash":{"id":"3865","name":"Wishbone Ash","friendly_url":"wishbone-ash","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-01","long_dates":"July 1","long_dates_with_day":"Sunday, July 1","description":"<p>Formed in 1969, Wishbone Ash has more than 20 original studio recordings and several live albums to their credit.

Over the course of their four studio albums, cumulative sales surpass&nbsp;<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">five million units a Grammy nomination and 4 top 10 singles. The band built a massive following on the road early in their career via high profile 2001 runs with Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Warped, and as the headliner on an MTV presented Fall Tour. In 2002, fame spread across the world, bringing Alien Ant Farm to the major European festivals, Australia's Big Day Out and a headline run in Japan. The following year they returned to Europe with Metallica, and to this day the band has steadily delivered audiences in territories across the globe.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>From the beginning, the clever humor of vocalist Dryden Mitchell and guitarist Terry Corso has delivered visual imagery that made the band vanguards in the realm of music video. All of the singles released received heavy rotation on MTV and MTV2, with \"Smooth Criminal\" was voted the #2 video of 2001 on MTV's countdown. They appeared on the channel's programs Celebrity Dismissed, MTV Cribbs, and hosted House of Style. Alongside the massive support from cable, Alien Ant Farm were darlings of broadcast television with multiple appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and support from Carson Daly, Extra, CNN, Access Hollywood and Mad-TV amongst many more. With all the notoriety also came a 2001 Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance in 2001.<br \/><br \/>The early history of the band began when the name came from a daydream Terry Corso had while employed at a day job. The concept revolves around the human species being cultivated by alien intelligence, and the colony forming much like it does in a traditional children's toy. In 1999, Alien Ant Farm self-released their debut titled Greatest Hits, which went on to win Best Independent Album at the L.A. Music Awards. In 2000, they signed to DreamWorks SKG, and went on to release Anthology. The following year, a cover of Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal\" became a massive hit overseas, rising to #1 in Australia and New Zealand, and on the U.S. Modern Rock charts. It also rose to #3 in the U.K. To set the record straight on the inspiration behind choosing this song amongst the millions of copyrights, Corso shares, \"When we were a young local band in SoCal, we'd play a different cover song by a different artist every show we would do. Wild unexpected stuff and sometimes not even songs we were that into. Just whatever was going on around us on the radio or whatever fit in with our inside jokes at that minute, from Ileah to Gary Glitter to The Police, we had a lot of fun with it. One week we had been throwing the idea of Michael Jackson's \"Smooth Criminal\" around the jam room, I believe someone had just watched Moonwalker again. The very next show we played, we hadn't learned the whole song yet but decided to klunk the main riff out for fun, the crowd loved it and went a little crazy. After that we learned the entire song and super charged it. The rest is pretty much history.\" To this day, the cover is a crowd pleaser. This past October 8th, the band was asked to appear alongside Cee Lo Green, Smokey Robinson and The Jackson Family at the Michael Jackson Forever Tribute Concert in Cardiff, Wales.<br \/><br \/>In 2003, the Alien Ant Farm entered the studio with Stone Temple Pilots' Robert and Dean DeLeo and cut Truant. Unfortunately, they ran in to unforeseen adversity with the closure of their record label, offering an insurmountable obstacle to continue building on the band's successes. Still under contract to Universal, Geffen green-lit the opportunity for Alien Ant Farm to return to the studio. In 2005, they recorded with Jim Wirt, but that album was not released as scheduled. Alien Ant Farm chose to share it with with fans via a bootlegged version, which has affectionately been re-named 3rd Draft by the public. Looking back on the adversity the band went through, alongside the massive fame Mitchell reflects, \"This Alien Ant Farm 'Wave' is a bigger, longer wave than I could have hoped for. All these years later, we are still intact. From friends to foes to friends again, this band is something special, and nothing short of tight and explosive.\"&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>The next year in 2006 Up In The Attic was issued, and for the next several years the members went their separate ways reconvening in 2009 for performances in Kansas City, the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, UK and at the WARPED Tour in memory of Michael Jackson. They were back, and come 2010 began to rebuild a legacy that grows with each passing month. The band staged a very successful tour over the Summer and Fall, where they road tested new material in front of the live audience. In the New Year, they'll release the new recordings. Mitchell shares, \"The First batch of these new songs are pretty to the point and pissed. Angry, but not negative. That is possible in this non tangible, musical and lyrical world. Unfortunately not possible in the real world, and that's why I love music. I can get this all out without hurting anyone.\"<br \/><br \/>Come 2014 Alien Ant Farm are back, and the path for the future will unfold one day at a time. As their career approaches two decades, Dryden offers, &ldquo;Its hard to believe we have been doing this as long as we have, I don&rsquo;t think any of us thought when we started out that our career would go onto do what it has, or that we would face some of the hurdles and losses that we have but here we stand ready to give our fans and the world another piece of Alien Ant Farm, we honestly have the best fans in the business, not only have they stuck with us through all of the personal up&rsquo;s and down&rsquo;s but they have never given up on our music and how we create and deliver what we feel is real and pure. We are ready to head down this path again and could not be happier with our new partners at The End Records, there&rsquo;s nothing like having a team of believers around you that support your visions.&rdquo;<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text_exposed_root text_exposed\"><span class=\"text_exposed_show\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AlienAntFarm_2_22_42_PM_4_3_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"June 28 - 4:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"June 28","start_time":"4:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alienantfarm\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/alienantfarmofficial\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6TZdvF1kFzwnQLgHQynzsO"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alienantfarmAAF"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/alienantfarm.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCS4K7vSumGqCQp3n1U994jg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:22:13 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"andreas-moss":{"id":"3970","name":"Andreas Moss","friendly_url":"andreas-moss","stages":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Sweden is a land at the mercy of extremes. Breaching the Arctic Circle, the country is beholden to the sun, the moon and glacial winds; extended summers bathing the landscape in 16- hour daylight and long winters bringing 16-hour nights.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that the nation is home to a cadre of creative pioneers; artists who exist in the interplay between darkness and light. For decades Sweden has garnered a reputation as a hothouse for artistic output ranging from the depths of black metal to Max Martin&rsquo;s pop machine churning out a seemingly endless export of leftfield hits.<\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in&nbsp; Sweden,&nbsp; Andreas&nbsp; Moss barely had a chance to choose music; rather, he inherited the family business. His parents, like theirs before them, were travelling musicians &ndash; &nbsp;by age nine, Moss was on tour, singing gospel tunes and navigating his way around the piano. Barely into his teens, Moss became a multi- faceted collaborator; a Swiss Army man of many talents, ghostwriting and directing music videos and short films for a growing community of artists.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s Moss&rsquo; solo outings, however, that really channel the extremes of his homeland; the 28- year old&rsquo;s hook-heavy pop reveals a muse borne from a certain darkness. These aren&rsquo;t breakup songs about the one that got away; they&rsquo;re defiant farewells to the devil on your shoulder.<\/p>\n<p>A catchy opening salvo that received over a&nbsp; million streams within a month of release, first single &lsquo;Thinking About You&rsquo; puts a face on the intoxicating grip of addiction. Over club-ready clockwork beats Moss&nbsp; reminisces&nbsp; about&nbsp; the dark allure that chews you up and spits you out, leaving you pining for the buzz of that last hit. Though it was years ago, the feeling is as electric as if it were yesterday.<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;Stop Me&rsquo; cuts even quicker to the chase; a sinister, electric anthem about the cry for help that you never hear; that torn veil between the desire to self-destruct and the desperation for&nbsp; a helping hand. It&rsquo;s a reminder that even within the depths of addiction, our better half is still searching for redemption.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a catharsis set to soaring electronic landscapes, with Moss&rsquo; anthemic voice rising above giant beats and synth hooks.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope it connects on different levels&rdquo;, says the songwriter of his left-leaning pop, &ldquo;I hope that people can appreciate it&nbsp; musically&nbsp; and fall in love with it on a sonic level. I also hope that people who want to dig deeper can find something else; a dark history, the stories that are under all the songs &ndash; pain and hope in equal measures. I hope they can hear it and think &lsquo;This guy gets how I feel.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_AndreasMoss_8_37_34_AM_3_29_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 4 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 4","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theandreasmoss\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/theandreasmoss\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/2g6nfqSFo2cPVrafnW85jm"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/theandreasmoss?lang=en"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.andreasmoss.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCdUTIjS3pmgFB9CNy7mwRXQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/03\/2018 02:26:28 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"bay-ledges":{"id":"3853","name":"Bay Ledges","friendly_url":"bay-ledges","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>The breakthrough single from Bay Ledges, \"Safe\" came to life in a moment of major creative upheaval. After spending few years in New York City, musician Zach Hurd took off for L.A., got a job at a restaurant in Venice, and put his music career on the backburner. While crashing at his sister Georgia's place, he soon began writing and recording on his own as a way to reconnect with the pure joy he'd found in making music as a kid.<br \/><br \/>\"I'd come home from work and record these songs and not really even think about releasing them, since they were so different from the heavier, more acoustic stuff I'd done before,\" says Hurd. \"It was just something to do for fun and to explore, without ever laboring over anything. The only goal was to get out of my own way and make songs that felt good to me.\"<br \/><br \/>Sunny yet soulful, warmly textured and sweetly melodic, \"Safe\" was sparked by the newfound sense of possibility that Hurd discovered in moving to L.A. \"It's a love song, but there's a bigger theme of meeting people who seem in touch with the magic of creating, especially the idea of creating just to create,\" Hurd points out. With its heart-on-sleeve sensibility, \"Safe\" reveals the delicate contrast at the heart of Bay Ledges, embodying both a carefree spirit and powerful depth.<br \/><br \/>In November 2016, at the urging of his sisters and friends, Hurd released \"Safe\" online but made no effort to promote it. Within weeks, the track landed on Spotify's Fresh Finds playlist, then shot up the Global Viral chart. \"At the time I was in Williamsburg, Virginia, helping to clear out my grandparents' old house,\" recalls Hurd, who's originally from Bath, Maine. \"Every day I'd wake up to something new. It was so surreal -- like, 'This unbelievable thing is happening, and I'm in Colonial Williamsburg and there's no one to celebrate with.'\" With \"Safe\" drawing attention from a host of record labels, Hurd soon signed with S- Curve Records and has been preparing for the release of Bay Ledges' debut EP.<br \/><br \/>Borrowing the name Bay Ledges from a plot of land his grandparents owned in the Maine woods, Hurd grew up on the Paul Simon and Beach Boys and Aretha Franklin records his parents spun at home. But while he started playing guitar in middle school and writing songs in his early teens, he mostly kept his music to himself. \"I was terrified to sing in front of anyone, so I was always secretive about it,\" says Hurd. It wasn't until his senior year of college that he began sharing his songs with the world. \"One night we were all hanging out in the dorm and one of my friends asked me to play something,\" says Hurd. \"He was like, 'Zach, we all hear you playing in your room all the time -- just play us a song.' I remember pulling the hood of my sweatshirt down over my eyes and being so embarrassed, and then when I was done they all burst out laughing, like, 'Dude, that was amazing!' It was just a side of me they'd never seen before.\"<br \/><br \/>After that night, Hurd began playing open-mic nights in Providence and -- once he'd graduated -- touring the country in a singer\/songwriter duo. Eventually settling in New York, he then dedicated himself to developing his career as a solo artist, a venture that included winning the International Independent Music Awards' Best Pop EP prize for 2013's She Never Sleeps.<br \/><br \/>Now at work on the EP from Bay Ledges, Hurd has made a point of sticking to the uncalculated approach he brought to the making of \"Safe.\" \"I used to get so focused on trying to express things in a poetic way, I'd end up not really saying anything at all,\" he says. \"This is the first time I've been able to stop myself from self-editing in my attempt to please others.\" With Bay Ledges evolving from a passion project to a fully realized musical outfit (also featuring vocals from sister Georgia), that lack of self-editing has served a higher purpose for Hurd. \"It's easy to get caught up in trying to come off a certain way,\" he says. \"Making this music lets me connect with myself. Throughout the creative process, I have to check in and make sure I'm not giving in to any pressure, and just go with the songs that are coming out of me, because those are the most honest. It's difficult sometimes, but it's also so freeing and so much more fun that way.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BayLedges_10_59_07_AM_3_28_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 4 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 4","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bayledges"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bayledges\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/7FhRUp59cBzPaxobsRY1Nc"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bayledges"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/bayledges.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC0DbIel3S-u9u40jDcFHNdA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:11 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jimmie-allen":{"id":"3774","name":"Jimmie Allen","friendly_url":"jimmie-allen","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-05","long_dates":"July 5","long_dates_with_day":"Thursday, July 5","description":"<p>For breakthrough country artist Jimmie Allen, a simple phrase sums up his view on life and music: Never give up.<\/p>\n<p>A native of Southern Delaware &ndash; the &ldquo;slower, lower&rdquo; part of the state, he explains &ndash; Allen has carried that mantra with him through good times and bad, whether than meant living in his car or rocking amphitheaters on Toby Keith&rsquo;s Interstates &amp; Tailgates Tour.<\/p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s poured out his soul at Music City&rsquo;s famous Bluebird Cafe, wrote a song that was featured in a Super Bowl commercial, and appeared in a Diet Coke ad with superstar Taylor Swift. But now with the BBR Music Group debut of his self-titled EP, a lifetime of never giving up has brought him full circle.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quit, I never will,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Stuff ain&rsquo;t easy, and you shouldn&rsquo;t quit either. There&rsquo;s a big difference between busting your ass, and sitting on it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For Allen, musical dreams and a love of true-to-themselves artists like Alan Jackson, Aaron Tippin, Montgomery Gentry, and Jason Aldean brought him all the way to Nashville &ndash; and eventually around the world for an Armed Forces Entertainment tour of Japan.<\/p>\n<p>But it was actually a nightmare which turned this promising singer into the artist he is today. After a series of bad breaks Allen was forced to live in his car, too proud to ask for a bail out. For months he worked multiple jobs and finally saved enough for an apartment, but hit then another snag &ndash; country music wasn&rsquo;t ready for him.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;People were just trying to help,&rdquo; he says now. &ldquo;But they wanted me to change my sound and told me I had to lose my boots. The turning point came when I stopped listening, and finally let my music be a natural reflection of who I am.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since then Allen has been following his own compass, and it&rsquo;s leading somewhere special.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; he explains about his trials. &ldquo;I think each thing you do adds a layer, whether it&rsquo;s a layer of toughness, perseverance, motivation, or just a layer of wisdom. At the end of the day you come back to what you know, and what&rsquo;s embedded in you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s embedded in Allen is a powerful, soulful sense of groove &ndash; &ldquo;If my body don&rsquo;t move in the first four seconds, it ain&rsquo;t for me,&rdquo; he says &ndash; a love of deep messages and a knack for razor-sharp hooks.<\/p>\n<p>Those driving forces form the bedrock Allen&rsquo;s EP, a cutting-edge mix of country, rock, R&amp;B, and pop produced by Ash Bowers and Eric Torres. Ironically, it&rsquo;s the same sound he had when he first arrived in Nashville, but now things are different.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Underdogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Best Shot&rdquo; reveal Allen&rsquo;s true story of laying it all on the line, while &ldquo;Back Home to You,&rdquo; &ldquo;Back of Your Mind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blue Jean Baby&rdquo; find the singer-songwriter reflecting on his journey to the spotlight &ndash; with all the love he left behind and romantic hopes included.<\/p>\n<p>Allen&rsquo;s hard-won dreams are finally reality, but he knows he can&rsquo;t rest now. Wrapped around his wrist is a homemade bracelet given to him by a fan. It bears another simple phrase &ndash; &ldquo;explore&rdquo; &ndash; and now it serves as a daily reminder.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;To me it means to explore every part of your heart that desires to do something,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;No matter what it is. Take a chance and never stop until you figure out where you&rsquo;re supposed to be.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_JimmieAllen_10_35_38_AM_3_29_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"U.S. Cellular Connection","date_time":"July 5 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"us-cellular-connection","date":"July 5","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jimmieallenmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jimmieallen\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/147nKr9upHZSSxqCzh9j7c"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jimmieallen"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.jimmieallenmusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCjbZuGdEaOTwXcNpFDtlKwQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/03\/2018 02:56:16 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"jake-rose":{"id":"3857","name":"Jake Rose","friendly_url":"jake-rose","stages":"us-cellular-connection","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>Jake Rose is a singer songwriter from Minneapolis Minnesota, and former frontman of Atlantic Records rock band &ldquo;New Medicine&rdquo;. &nbsp;Jake has written songs for Meatloaf, Colt Ford, Keith Urban, Kid Rock and is currently writing for Rezonant Music Publishing. &nbsp;Jake is currently making his debut solo record with Taylor Swift producer Nathan Chapman and All About That Bass creator Kevin Kadish.

John N&eacute;meth had already established himself&nbsp;among the very top ranks of blues musicians and modern soul singers when he decided to break the mold with his&nbsp;new record, FEELIN&rsquo; FREAKY. N&eacute;meth fearlessly crushes all barriers of style and genre with an album of original&nbsp;songs that defies all the usual pigeonholes. Drawing from his strong influences in blues and R&amp;B, as well as&nbsp;contemporary sounds in hip hop and rock &amp; roll, John creates music that is personal as well as universal, and owes&nbsp;its origin to no one but John N&eacute;meth. John&rsquo;s songs are groove and melody-driven, laced with thoughtful lyrics and&nbsp;nuanced humor, and cover themes from social issues of gun violence and class values to the pure hedonistic joy of&nbsp;dancing, sexuality and marijuana. He creates his songs from melodies and phrases he draws from the sounds of&nbsp;life, from early-morning Memphis songbirds to the din of the city. For this album John brought his new songs to his&nbsp;great touring band, the Blue Dreamers &ndash; Danny Banks on drums, Matthew Wilson on bass and guitar, and Johnny&nbsp;Rhodes on guitar &ndash; so they could hone the groove and finish building the album as a group. Under the simpatico&nbsp;guidance of Grammy-nominated producer Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars), FEELIN&rsquo; FREAKY emerges&nbsp;as a modern personal masterpiece.<\/p>\n<p>This album is a testament to power with taste and restraint, dramatic dynamics through the use of space. N&eacute;meth&rsquo;s&nbsp;striking tenor vocals are already legendary, with a pitch-perfect purity of range and power that has drawn&nbsp;comparisons to soul singers from O.V. Wright to James Brown. He keeps that power under a tight leash, letting it rip&nbsp;at just the right places, using his voice to deliver and serve the song. N&eacute;meth is also a very accomplished&nbsp;harmonica player who can boogie with the best of them, in various diatonic positions as well as on the mighty&nbsp;Chromatic harp, yet he plays relatively little on this record. What he plays are largely horn lines, trumpet-like&nbsp;staccato blasts that serve to create dramatic dynamic shifts, tension and release, all in service to the song, not the&nbsp;ego of the player. The few solos he delivers are concise, tasty and powerful.<\/p>\n<p>FEELIN&rsquo; FREAKY was recorded at the Dickinson family&rsquo;s Zebra Ranch Studios in Mississippi and Willie Mitchell&rsquo;s&nbsp;legendary Royal Studios in Memphis. N&eacute;meth&rsquo;s touring band on their instruments and background vocals is at the&nbsp;heart of the recordings, along with musicians hand-picked to complement the individual tracks. John often works&nbsp;with horns, and Memphis players Marc Franklin (trumpet, flugelhorn) and Art Edmaiston (Tenor, Bari sax) deliver&nbsp;echoes of classic Memphis sound all over this record. N&eacute;meth and Dickinson agreed that the B-3 Organ parts had&nbsp;to go to Charles Hodges, who contributed so much to the Hi Records sound on albums by the likes of Al Green and&nbsp;Ann Peebles. For extra depth and sweetness, they added strings by J. Kirkscey, B. Luscombe, J. Munson and P.&nbsp;Tsai.<\/p>\n<p>A little history:<\/p>\n<p>As a Boise, Idaho teenager in the early &lsquo;90s, John N&eacute;meth was drawn to the hard-edged hip hop sounds and rock&nbsp;bands of the day &ndash; but when a friend exposed him to Buddy Guy and Junior Wells&rsquo;s classic &ldquo;Hoodoo Man Blues,&rdquo; he&nbsp;was hooked. John played harp and sang in local bands, often opening the show for nationally touring blues acts.&nbsp;John soon caught the ear of established blues musicians, and before long he was releasing his own CDs &ndash; THE&nbsp;JACK OF HARPS (2002) and COME AND GET IT (2004), featuring Junior Watson &ndash; and performing in Junior&nbsp;Watson&rsquo;s band. John relocated to San Francisco in 2004, where he wound up doing a two-year stint with Anson&nbsp;Funderburgh and the Rockets, filling in for the ailing Sam Myers.<\/p>\n<p>N&eacute;meth immersed himself in the deep musical waters of the Bay area, absorbing more of the soul and funk grooves&nbsp;of what he calls &ldquo;the early East Bay Grease sound&rdquo; of San Francisco and Oakland bands. John&rsquo;s reputation&nbsp;continued to grow, and he soon signed a recording contract with Blind Pig Records. His national debut for that label&nbsp;&ndash; MAGIC TOUCH (2007), produced by Anson Funderburgh and featuring Junior Watson on guitar &ndash; received an&nbsp;ecstatic response from fans and the media, and he was hailed as the new voice of the Blues. Living Blues Magazine&nbsp;enthused, &ldquo;Magic Touch gives hope that the blues will survive.&rdquo; In 2008 N&eacute;meth was recruited by Elvin Bishop to do&nbsp;some performances and contribute four vocal tracks to his Grammy-nominated album THE BLUES ROLLS ON.<\/p>\n<p>N&eacute;meth released two more albums on the Blind Pig label &ndash; LOVE ME TONIGHT (2009), NAME THE DAY! (2010) &ndash;&nbsp;earning critical raves and strong sales, both hitting #6 on the Billboard Top Blues Album Charts, and beginning his&nbsp;long string of Blues Music Award nominations, numbering fourteen at last count. John also won two Blues Blast&nbsp;Music Awards &ndash; Best New Artist Debut Recording and Sean Costello Rising Star Award &ndash; voted on by nearly 11,000&nbsp;blues fans. John followed up with two independently released live albums, BLUES LIVE and SOUL LIVE in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013 John relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, where he quickly became a key player in the city&rsquo;s rich musical&nbsp;scene. He teamed up with producer Scott Bomar and his classic Memphis Soul band, the Bo-Keys to create an&nbsp;album of revisited Soul classics, MEMPHIS GREASE (2014), on the Blue Corn label, which debuted at #4 on the&nbsp;Billboard Blues Chart. John won the 2104 Blues Music Award in the Soul Blues Male Artist category, and MEMPHIS&nbsp;GREASE took the prize for Soul Blues Album in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>John N&eacute;meth continues to be one of the hottest stars in the musical firmament, touring nationally and internationally&nbsp;with his Memphis band, taking the world by storm. He is currently nominated for a 2017 Blues Music Award in the&nbsp;category of B.B. King Entertainer of the Year . FEELIN&rsquo; FREAKY will be released in May 2017, on John&rsquo;s own&nbsp;Memphis Grease label, and it&rsquo;s already generating a firestorm among his devoted fans and the media.

After five decades in the game, Trout is a talismanic figure and part of the glue that bonds the blues community together, at a time when the wider world has never been so divided. He&rsquo;s also the only artist with the vision, talent and star-studded address book to pull off a project on the scale of <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em>. &ldquo;It was quite a piece of work to get this record together,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;But I guess I have a lot of friends, y&rsquo;know&hellip;?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Before you even hear a note, <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em> has your attention. Drafting fourteen A-list stars &ndash; including Joe Bonamassa, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, John Mayall and Randy Bachman &ndash; and writing an original song for each, Trout has made the most tantalizing album of the year, and found solace after a run of solo albums that chronicled his near-fatal liver disease of 2014. &ldquo;Now was the right time for this record,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;<em>Battle Scars<\/em> [2015] was such an intense piece of work, written with tears coming down my face. I needed a break from that, to do something fun and light-hearted. This album was joyous for me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Scan the credits of <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em> and you&rsquo;ll find nods to every twist and turn of Trout&rsquo;s electrifying backstory. There&rsquo;s keys man and long-time friend Skip Edwards, who came up on the same early-&rsquo;70s New Jersey circuit where Trout cut his teeth as the precocious lead guitarist for Wilmont Mews. There&rsquo;s organ wizard Deacon Jones, the West Coast bandleader who brought a twenty-something Trout into the orbit of blues titans like John Lee Hooker and Big Mama Thornton. &ldquo;Deacon sorta discovered me when I moved to LA in the &rsquo;70s,&rdquo; reflects Trout. &ldquo;So I owe him.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Trout also welcomes a fistful of compadres from recent all-star project Supersonic Blues Machine, in the form of Warren Haynes, Robben Ford and Eric Gales. Then there&rsquo;s John Mayall: the ageless British blues-boom godfather who hired a troubled Trout for the Bluesbreakers in 1985 and now blows harp on &ldquo;<em>Blues For Jimmy T<\/em>.&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I proud to call myself a former Bluesbreaker?&rdquo; Trout reflects. &ldquo;Yeah, of course. What a credential. That is a very exclusive club, and I know that when I&rsquo;m gone, that&rsquo;s gonna be one of the big things that they&rsquo;ll remember me for: that I was a Bluesbreaker for five years.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Since he struck out alone in 1989, Trout&rsquo;s solo career has been every bit as celebrated. Touring tirelessly and spitting out classic albums that include 1990&rsquo;s flag-planting <em>Life In The Jungle<\/em>, 1998&rsquo;s breakthrough <em>Walter Trout<\/em> and 2012&rsquo;s politically barbed <em>Blues For The Modern Daze<\/em>, he&rsquo;s won international acclaim and enjoyed ever-growing sales in a notoriously fickle industry. Years on the road have also brought him tight friendships, as evidenced by 2006&rsquo;s cameo-fuelled <em>Full Circle<\/em> album and this year&rsquo;s unofficial sequel, <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em>. &ldquo;The new album was originally gonna be called <em>Full Circle Volume 2<\/em>,&rdquo; notes Trout, &ldquo;but I wanted to make the title a positive statement in this time of madness.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In another departure, whereas <em>Full Circle<\/em> saw each guest visit the studio to track their part, the advance of recording technology in the intervening decade meant Trout&rsquo;s collaborators on <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em> were able to supply their contributions from afar. &ldquo;In the studio, it was the core band of me, Sammy Avila [keys], Mike Leasure [drums] and Johnny Griparic [bass] on every cut, with Eric Corne producing,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;and then, for most of the tracks, people sent us their parts. But it&rsquo;s very hard to tell we&rsquo;re not in the studio together. If you listen to the Warren Haynes track, when we get into that guitar conversation on the end &ndash; it sounds like we&rsquo;re looking each other right in the face, y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>They say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. If that&rsquo;s the case, then <em>We&rsquo;re All In This Together<\/em> is further proof of Walter Trout&rsquo;s position at the hub of the blues scene. This is the sound of an artist not just getting by with a little help from his friends, but positively thriving, on an album that is sure to light another rocket under his blooming late career. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 66 years old,&rdquo; considers Trout, &ldquo;but I feel like I&rsquo;m in the best years of my life right now. I feel better than I have in years physically. I have more energy. I have a whole different appreciation of being alive, of the world, of my family, of my career. I want life to be exciting and celebratory. I want to dig in. I want to grab life by the balls and not let go, y&rsquo;know&hellip;?&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WalterTrout_11_54_02_AM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 5 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 5","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/waltertroutband\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/walter_trout\/?hl=en"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/12LgviUQ9DbfYJJ9niDWRq"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/waltertrout?lang=en"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.waltertrout.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCD7xfglbI7kOfq54qJ2BxIw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:14 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"the-wombats":{"id":"3804","name":"The Wombats","friendly_url":"the-wombats","stages":"bmo-harris-pavilion","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p>Los Angeles: a city of contrasts. On one hand, a metropolis of aspirations, a place which offers the transient a tantalising glimpse of glamour and permanence. On the other, many dreams drift away, deserted within an urban personification of unfulfilled ambitions. It might not seem like the most obvious place around which to theme an album for a band rooted in Liverpool (albeit via Norway in the case of bassist Tord &Oslash;verland Knudsen, or onto London for frontman Matthew 'Murph' Murphy), but that's precisely what The Wombats have done with their third set \"Glitterbug,\" a collection which follows their top five hit \"This Modern Glitch.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Completed by drummer Dan Haggis, The Wombats have a long association with Los Angeles. They've played in and around the city numerous times since the release of their debut \"A Guide To Love, Loss and Desperation,\" and even recorded their second album \"This Modern Glitch\" there too. For the band's core songwriter Murph it also proved to be a fount of inspiration, which gradually mutated into a magnetic attraction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Along with Liverpool and London, Los Angeles is my favourite place in the world, but I used to hate it,\" admits Murph. Part of the appeal was its versatility: the ability to experience \"the opulence and anxiety\" of the city or the rejuvenating qualities of the easily accessible countryside that lies just outside its borders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As the process of working on a new album drifted over the horizon, Murph's internal dialogue took on a questioning tone, notably: what was it that inspired him to write in the first place? He soon realised that his greatest strength was writing about both the romance and the failings of modern relationships. The first new song, \"Isabelle,\" placed those issues within the realm of a seductive new location.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"That was based on an idea of going through tumultuous times with a fictional woman from L.A.,\" he explains. \"That became the main inspiration for most of the songs, this false world that I'd created for myself. As time progressed, I'd go to L.A. more and more, and the idea kept on building. The album's about the envy and the struggle and the pretence and the worry and the fear that L.A. -- and every major city in the world -- encompasses.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Instrumentally, most of the songs took one of two directions: back in Liverpool, Tord and Dan's rush of creativity would result in them delivering backing tracks as a foundation for Murph to then build upon in L.A. or London; alternatively Murph would develop the essence of a song on guitar or piano for the band to collectively flesh out -- a process that had served them so well in the past. The slick Eighties synth grooves of \"Headspace,\" for example, originated as an initial idea from Tord before Murph expanded it into one of the album's strongest moments: \"I wanted that whole song to feel like you were driving a Cadillac, coming down or hungover. Like an antidote to 'The Boys of Summer.'\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In January 2014, approximately halfway through the writing process, events conspired to curve full-circle from fiction into fact when Murph started dating a seemingly unattainable woman from the city. It was, he admits almost gleefully, a decidedly creepy coincidence. And so imaginary stories evolved into real life concerns: the fading embers of his relationship back in London and the challenges of maintaining a long distance relationship.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Be Your Shadow\" is a prime example of a lyric about the reality of that person, and \"Give Me A Try\" was written after she returned home from visiting Murph in London. \"I was distraught. I just felt like a part of me was missing,\" he shudders. \"I really love that song. It's special to me because it has a far more positive outlook than what you've heard from us in the past.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When it came to recording, The Wombats changed course from the plan which dictated \"This Modern Glitch.\" Instead of collaborating with an army of star names, the majority of the album was recorded at Bastille producer Mark Crew's studio in Battersea. Vitally, Crew exuded a calming influence to counteract the band's shared collection of irrational neuroses.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Glitterbug\" certainly demonstrates that their efforts have resulted in the band's finest album to date. \"Your Body is a Weapon\" -- inspired by the sight of a disinterested pap snapping Harry Styles after an awards party -- was first to emerge when it was released as a stop-gap sweetener to the band's devoted fanbase. The rest of the album is just as compelling.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Excitingly for the band, \"Emoticons\" is a track which is often met with a \"is that you guys?\" reaction when played to outsiders; the elastic bass that permeates \"Be Your Shadow\" imbues the track with a pulsating disco rhythm; while \"Greek Tragedy\" floats an East Asian-infused synth riff over booming, distorted drum beats. Collectively it snakes subconsciously into the leftfield but it's recognisably The Wombats.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another of the album's key moments comes with \"This is Not a Party.\" Although The Wombats had previously been renowned as a band who could party as hard as anyone, some \"fairly sizeable\" nights out in the summer of 2013 saw Murph seesaw from celebratory hedonism to a borderline existential crisis -- all of which he has documented here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"Those nights were a lot of fun, but they came with a hefty price,\" he summarises. \"They led me to question what the hell we were all doing and, more importantly, why we were doing it? This song was one of the easiest to write and most challenging to record. I also decided to name-drop everyone involved, and no one has complained yet. Apart from Charlie.\"&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Despite the album's focus on L.A. and the band's growing geographical displacement, The Wombats remain a Liverpudlian band at heart. Tord and Dan still live there, with the band's rehearsal room also in the locality. Similarly Murph is proud of his roots, despite plotting a move to Los Angeles in the longer term. \"I'm actually excited about how much of an awful struggle I'm going to have to make it a reality,\" he laughs. \"It's going to be great.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For now, though, all thoughts are focused on the band's return with \"Glitterbug.\" It's taken a while due to the recording schedule, two solid years of touring as well as 2014 delivering yet another hectic summer schedule of European festival dates, but The Wombats are truly thrilled by the prospect of the wider world finally hearing it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><br \/> \"This album is the reconciliation,\" affirms Murph defiantly. \"They say your first album is luck, your second is a rebellion and your third is what defines you. As proud as I am of the first two albums, I think 'Glitterbug' will be what defines The Wombats.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_WombatsThe_5_13_35_PM_3_13_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"BMO Harris Pavilion","date_time":"July 4 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"bmo-harris-pavilion","date":"July 4","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thewombatsuk"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wombatsofficial\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0Ya43ZKWHTKkAbkoJJkwIB"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thewombats"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.thewombats.co.uk\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/thewombats"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:22:47 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"liza-anne":{"id":"3868","name":"Liza Anne","friendly_url":"liza-anne","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p>&ldquo;Growing up, people would always say I was too happy to be depressed, or too social to have anxiety,&rdquo; says Liza Anne Odachowski, the critically acclaimed songwriter better known these days by her stage name Liza Anne. &ldquo;In their eyes, because I was one thing, I couldn&rsquo;t also be something else. I think we all exist in duality, though. I can be everything and nothing all at once.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Duality is at the core of Liza Anne&rsquo;s arresting new album, &lsquo;Fine But Dying,&rsquo; her debut release for indie powerhouse label Arts &amp; Crafts. Synthesizing the elegant sincerity of Angel Olsen with the wry lyricism of Courtney Barnett and the unapologetic candor of Feist, the music is both tough and vulnerable, bold and withdrawn, a helping hand and a middle finger. Firing on all cylinders with distorted alt-rock guitars and explosive drums one minute, hushed and delicate the next, it&rsquo;s an eclectic collection that reflects the messy complications of growing up in the modern age, as the 23-year-old grapples with the fallout of falling in love, reckons with the patriarchy, and stares down the panic disorder she refuses to let define her. &lsquo;Fine But Dying&rsquo; is the sound of an artist taking total control of her life and her art, a proud misfit crafting an aggressively infectious kiss-off to an industry (and a society) that&rsquo;s tried to box her in from day one.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Being a young woman playing music in Nashville, everybody had their opinions of who I should be and what I should do next,&rdquo; says Liza Anne, whose music is as decidedly un-Nashville as it gets. &ldquo;They wanted me to be happier and softer and easier because people are conditioned to only experience women in entertainment as a force of goodness and kindness and light. But just because I&rsquo;m a woman doesn&rsquo;t mean I have to be soft and happy and nurturing all the time. It&rsquo;s pretty inhumane to expect a human being to represent only one side of themselves. We embody too many contradictions.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;Fine But Dying&rsquo; follows Liza Anne&rsquo;s self-released 2015 breakout album, &lsquo;Two,&rsquo; which garnered more than 20 million streams worldwide. <em>NPR <\/em>praised the record&rsquo;s &ldquo;deeply introspective&rdquo; songwriting and &ldquo;searing reflections,&rdquo; while <em>Nylon<\/em> called it &ldquo;a stunningly somber album&rdquo; and dubbed Liza an artist with the &ldquo;keen ability to turn even the smallest of feelings into a sweeping song.&rdquo; The record earned her dates with Joseph, Margaret Glaspy, The Oh Hellos, and Bears Den, among others, as well as festival slots from ACL to Daytrotter Downs.<\/p>\n<p>Though Liza Anne commands a stage like she was born to do it, a career in music was far from her mind as she grew up in the quaint, sheltered community of Saint Simons Island, Georgia. She discovered songwriting one summer at sleepaway camp, when a guitar class helped her realize that the notebooks she&rsquo;d been filling with poetry and prose could be set to melodies. Raised in a deeply religious household, Liza&rsquo;s first taste of public performance came on Sundays when she served as a local worship leader, and though she&rsquo;s since moved on from the church, the experience proved to be formative for her.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I learned at a very young age how to manipulate an entire room full of people to feel what I&rsquo;m feeling,&rdquo; she says with a laugh.<\/p>\n<p>When it came time to cut &lsquo;Fine But Dying,&rsquo; Liza Anne brought both her band and her producer, Zach Dyke, to France&rsquo;s legendary La Frette studio, a 19<sup>th<\/sup> century mansion on the banks of the Seine. Dyke and Liza&rsquo;s recording chemistry had been undeniable since they first met during college in Nashville, and though Liza dropped out of school to tour full time, the pair&rsquo;s creative relationship continued to grow deeper and break new ground.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Zach is my best friend and my magic charm,&rdquo; reflects Liza Anne. &ldquo;Working with him just feels like working with your other arm or another part of your brain.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In a six-day whirlwind, they recorded eleven new songs that embodied the raw energy and tense emotion that Liza Anne had long carried in her head but never yet captured on tape.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is my &lsquo;woman at her wildest self&rsquo; album,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a place for me to express all of the things about womanhood and the human condition that I was experiencing without fear of feeling like I&rsquo;m &lsquo;too much&rsquo; or &lsquo;not enough.&rsquo; People used to talk about my music in such sweet terms, but they weren&rsquo;t sweet things that I was going through. With this record, I&rsquo;m not sugarcoating anything any more.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>On album opener &ldquo;Paranoia,&rdquo; Liza Anne weaves together lilting pop sensibilities with moments of frenetic release as she confronts insecurity and doubt. The result is an addictive, Cranberries-meets-St. Vincent gem, and it proves to be a perfect entry point to an album unafraid to bare the multitudes it contains. Liza&rsquo;s crystalline voice is alternately beguiling and jarring as she sets her distress to music on &ldquo;Panic Attack,&rdquo; sends up the hollow phoniness of southern hospitality on &ldquo;Small Talks,&rdquo; and sneers and snarls her way through the third-wave feminist anthem of &ldquo;Kid Gloves.&rdquo; On the gentle but bruising &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tired, You&rsquo;re Lonely&rdquo; she channels the eerie beauty of Jeff Buckley, while &ldquo;Closest To Me&rdquo; is a reverb-soaked look in the mirror, and &ldquo;Control&rdquo; faces off against some of the darker voices in her head.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are moments in the song &lsquo;Control&rsquo; that question what it feels like to be in love,&rdquo; says Liza Anne. &ldquo;The whole album is really a catalog of my first few years of falling in love with someone but doubting I had the capacity to actually do it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&lsquo;Fine But Dying&rsquo; proves that Liza Anne is a woman with the capacity to do far more than she&rsquo;d ever given herself credit for. By casting off the restrictions of who and what she &ldquo;should&rdquo; be, by writing with unrepentant emotion and without concern for the constructs and confines of &ldquo;femininity,&rdquo; she was able to discover her truest self and create an album of incredible power and vision, one that fully reflects the rich duality of its author.<\/p>\n<p>\"This album gave me space to find my voice,&rdquo; says Liza Anne. &ldquo;In the end, I always want to make art that's provocative and that challenges the stereotypes of what women are supposed to be or how they are usually experienced.

Over knotty, distorted guitars and churning bass, Allison is equal turns confrontational and vulnerable. &ldquo;I want a love that lets me breathe\/I&rsquo;ve been choking on your leash.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a mission statement, a reclamation of power, a rewriting of all indie rock&rsquo;s rules.<\/p>\n<p>Soccer Mommy is the project of twenty-year-old Sophie Allison, a Nashville native. She cut her teeth in her local DIY scene, going to shows and hanging out with other musicians, though she kept her own songwriting secret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played music since I was six,&rdquo; says Allison, &ldquo;and I always wrote songs just for myself. I did it for fun, posting songs on Tumblr, Bandcamp, and Soundcloud. I didn&rsquo;t think anyone would notice.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>All that changed the summer before Allison left for college. She bought a Tascam digital recorder and began to experiment with production, pushing the quality and craft of her songs to new heights. A buzz began to grow around her Bandcamp recordings, leading to live shows and eventually a record deal, with 2017&rsquo;s critically acclaimed bedroom-recorded compilation Collection. &ldquo;I realized that I could do this full-time,&rdquo; says Allison. &ldquo;It was either quit school now and do it, or stop growing as an artist. It was now or never.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>So Allison took the plunge. She quit school, moved back home to Nashville, shifting all her focus to music. She toured with Mitski, Jay Som, Slowdive, and others, and was featured in the New York Times article &ldquo;Rock&rsquo;s Not Dead, It&rsquo;s Ruled By Women.&rdquo; The bedroom project of Sophie Allison is now a full-time band with a new studio-album debut, Clean. Produced by Gabe Wax (War On Drugs, Deerhunter, Beirut) and mixed by Ali Chant (Perfume Genius, PJ Harvey), Clean is Allison&rsquo;s journey out of the bedroom and into the studio.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted it to be a lot more cohesive than the rest of the stuff that came before,&rdquo; says Allison, on her decision to record in a studio. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never made a full album before, just EPs and random tracks thrown together. I wanted to make something that was a full piece of my life, that addressed similar themes and held together as a whole.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The higher production values play to Allison&rsquo;s strengths, highlighting the maturity and growth of her songwriting. The music gains clarity and power, losing none of the trademark intimacy of her Bandcamp work, something Allison credits to days spent recording in Wax&rsquo;s home studio. &ldquo;It still felt do-it-yourself,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t feel like making a pop album. It was like being in a nicer bedroom, with better quality stuff. It was a natural progression. I&rsquo;d always wanted my music to sound this way, I just didn&rsquo;t have the means before.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Still Clean&rdquo; is a stunner of an opening track, with the signature warmth of Allison&rsquo;s voice coupled with one of her best hooks. It&rsquo;s mostly Allison alone with her electric guitar, playing chords and singing about an ephemeral, passing love. The song is full of heartache and defiance, equal measures vulnerability and strength, and it&rsquo;s Allison at her best. It&rsquo;s also a bridge of sorts, with synth flourishes rising in a crescendo behind her, ushering the listener into Soccer Mommy&rsquo;s new, high-definition world.<\/p>\n<p>Allison&rsquo;s growth as a lyricist is most evident on &ldquo;Cool&rdquo;, a sharply observed character study describing an aloof stoner girl, so cool and untouchable, and the agony she inflicts on her boyfriend. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll break your heart and steal your joy\/like a criminal,&rdquo; sings Allison, full of venom and bitterness. But what starts as a lyrical evisceration of the girl in question transforms into awe, even admiration, on the chorus: &ldquo;I wanna know her like you\/I wanna be that cool.&rdquo; Suddenly the cold-hearted girl becomes the hero, and the song becomes a meditation on identity, on wishing to be someone else for a while.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Flaw&rdquo; is the comedown from a song like &ldquo;Cool.&rdquo; A melancholy ode to lovesick self-loathing, Allison sings, &ldquo;I choose to blame it all on you\/ &lsquo;Cause I don&rsquo;t like the truth.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s an ecstasy in being sad, and the chorus of &ldquo;Flaw&rdquo; nails that feeling perfectly. &ldquo;Scorpio Rising&rdquo; crystalizes these themes of identity, jealousy, and the desire to be someone else. What starts as an acoustic ballad, harkening back to the Soccer Mommy bedroom days, quickly transforms into a full-band doomed love song. &ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re made from the stars\/That we watched from your car,&rdquo; sings Allison, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m just a victim of changing planets\/My Scorpio Rising and my parents.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Clean presents Sophie Allison as a singular artist, wise beyond her years, with an emotional authenticity all her own. &ldquo;It feels like my first real record,&rdquo; says Allison. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first real statement.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s an emotional album, heavy on themes of growth, isolation, and change, but balanced by a lightness of touch, and with hooks to spare. Clean is a true step forward, a mature, powerful album from an artist just coming into her power.&nbsp;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SoccerMommy_10_09_29_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 8 - 4:15 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 8","start_time":"4:15 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/soccermommymusic\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/soccermommyband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4wXchxfTTggLtzkoUhO86Q"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sopharela"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/sopharela.bandcamp.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC0C1XF4HDRDLZ0c25blKAtQ"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"caroline-rose":{"id":"3783","name":"Caroline Rose","friendly_url":"caroline-rose","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>An obsession with money, an unfaithful lover, a friend&rsquo;s accidental pregnancy, misogyny, loneliness, death&hellip; This is just some of the lighthearted subject matter that make up LONER&ndash;&ndash;the darkly comedic second album from songwriter\/producer Caroline Rose. Armed with an arsenal of new instruments and equipment, an ever-growing sense of &ldquo;ahhh fuck it,&rdquo; two years of exploration, and a wicked sense of humor, Rose delivers a set of serious songs wrapped in a sprightly, angsty pop burrito. Because, as Rose puts it, &ldquo;Sometimes sad songs just need a cocktail.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>LONER captures the cheeky satire, comical musings, and often jarring mood swings&ndash;&ndash;sometimes goofy, sometimes emotional&ndash;&ndash;that make up much of Rose&rsquo;s personality. &ldquo;I call it Schizodrift,&rdquo; she says sipping on a martini with her pinky out. &ldquo;I want to make music that sounds as manic as I feel.&rdquo; Filled with catchy synth hooks, Ray Manzarek-esque Farfisa, surf guitar, depth of thought and a punk attitude, LONER captures the energy of bands like Le Tigre and The Cramps, and nods to the styles of Blondie and DEVO, the pop hooks of icons like Justin Timberlake, all the while being inspired by the artistry of Kate Bush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say this album was as much inspired by Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears as it was late 70s punk.&rdquo; How did she get here? According to Rose, the transition was natural.<\/p>\n<p>LONER began about three years ago. &ldquo;I was 24, lonely, and realizing life might actually be as hard as people said it was. Gandalf had yet to raise his staff and part the seas for me,&rdquo; she says with a straight face. &ldquo;I felt a bit disillusioned with my music; it didn&rsquo;t sound like my personality. I hadn&rsquo;t dated in years, I was going to lose health care. I felt detached from the modern world.&rdquo; So what did she do about it? &ldquo;I joined Tinder. I turned 25 and rented my first real apartment and painted it bright colors. I started socializing more and little by little, weeded out all my clothes that weren&rsquo;t red. I embraced my queerdom. I had a girlfriend, we traveled the country, we broke up. I discussed politics, capitalism and Rihanna. For better or worse, I became a member of the modern world. Turns out the modern world is terrifying,&rdquo; she says attempting to pluck an olive out of her glass.<\/p>\n<p>When it came to writing about all of it, what followed marked the beginning of a fully formed Caroline Rose. &ldquo;I needed to get more personal, more aggressive. more humorous and more sonically diverse than my older material,&rdquo; referring to 2014&rsquo;s slinky indie-folk-rockabilly-tinged album I Will Not Be Afraid. The record was penned over four years ago while Rose was living in a van traveling the country, and received critical acclaim from national press outlets like NPR and Rolling Stone. LONER, however, marks a significant leap forward both sonically and emotionally, unleashing a burgeoning confidence teeming with character. Asked how she&rsquo;d describe the transition, Rose responds, &ldquo;It just felt like a bubble inside me that had been growing and was about to pop.&rdquo; In a burst of creative energy, she penned and produced a slew of songs that began circulating among labels and press, resulting in a Tiny Desk Concert for NPR Music.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next year and a half, Rose &ldquo;got super into production and mixing&ndash;&ndash;I was working 10-hour days creating new sounds, finessing EQ, blending tones, sampling basically everything. Having an apartment [rather than living in a van] gave me the space to have more instruments than just a guitar. I started collecting synths and recording equipment and tracking my material. I signed with a label that gave me a lot of creative control and resources.&rdquo; After sessions and meetings with over a dozen producers, Rose chose to co-produce alongside Paul Butler (Devendra Banhart, Michael Kiwanuka, Hurray For The Riff Raff) at Panoramic Studio in Stinson Beach, California and the studios of Butler and Rose. A multi-instrumentalist and producer herself, Rose brought to the sessions pre-recorded work the two used as a foundation off which to build, having written and arranged strings, played and recorded keys, guitar and bass, sampled layers of found and recorded sounds, and programmed synths and drums. &ldquo;The rest was a lot of experimentation in the studio, trying out different sounds and getting weird,&rdquo; She adds. &ldquo;Paul added a lot in that way. Neither of us are afraid to try things and throw a bunch of sounds at the wall.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that drove Rose to pursue production more seriously was the blatant lack of gender diversity in the music industry. &ldquo;I noticed over the course of all these meetings there was not a single female or nonbinary producer. Then the more I read up on why, the more I realized there actually are a lot of us, we just aren&rsquo;t taken as seriously and either don&rsquo;t receive or don&rsquo;t demand the credit that we deserve.&rdquo; In response, Rose stepped up across the board, having a hand in mixing as well as directing creative control over all aesthetics regarding the album. &ldquo;I wanted to make sure everything was as me as it could possibly be.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>According to Rose, the visuals and aesthetics of LONER are an important vehicle in bringing out her personality, as well as a lot of the more sarcastic elements within the music. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten really interested in the visuals over the years, from producing videos and creatively crafting the images to how I express myself via what I wear.&rdquo; The video for &ldquo;Money,&rdquo; for example, written and directed by Rose and Horatio Baltz, depicts Rose playing all of the parts&ndash;&ndash;a sort of maniacal, Coen Brothers-meets-David Lynch two-minute story involving three people (perhaps the same person?) that leaves viewers asking&hellip;What just happened? Not too different a feeling after listening to LONER, in fact. And this, is precisely how Caroline Rose wants you to feel.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_CarolineRose_10_04_20_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"5:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carolinerosemusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/carolinerosemuzak\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/06W84OT2eFUNVwG85UsxJw"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/carolinerosefm"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.carolinerosemusic.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCOLhg6XeLefXjSTE_KdILkw"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:23:58 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"abby-jeanne":{"id":"3770","name":"Abby Jeanne","friendly_url":"abby-jeanne","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">\"Milwaukee wailer Abby Jeanne has a robust, jazzy voice that rivals the greats&mdash;Ella, Amy, even Janis.

With a name that stems from the line, &ldquo;Getting close to bedtime, time to wake,&rdquo; in their song, &ldquo;Fever,&rdquo; the intention has always been clear: to &ldquo;wake people&rdquo; with their music. In a short amount of time the band has already conquered festival stages at ACL, Hangout, SXSW, Firefly and Wakarusa.

But blue is also the United Nations&rsquo; internationally recognized color of peace; the stripe in the rainbow on the Pride flag that represents serenity; and the &ldquo;emotional color&rdquo; of Sunflower Bean&rsquo;s upcoming sparkling second album, Twentytwo in Blue. &ldquo;We definitely don&rsquo;t want it to come across as a sad record,&rdquo; explains Cumming. &ldquo;Blue is kind of hopeful, and we wanted to explore that color with this record.&rdquo; The new LP by vocalist and bassist Cumming, drummer Jacob Faber and guitarist and vocalist Nick Kivlen is many things: rousing, romantic, topical, empathetic and insightful. But defeatist it&rsquo;s not.<\/p>\n<p>All three band members will in fact be 22 when Twentytwo in Blue is released in March of 2018, almost two years and two months after Sunflower Bean&rsquo;s hazy, charming debut LP, Human Ceremony. They were two momentous years for the trio, who&rsquo;ve now toured the world multiple times over on headlining stints and as support for indie rock essentials like DIIV, Best Coast, The Vaccines, Pixies and Wolf Alice. By the month, they only grew in accomplishment, and gained a newly confident voice they bring to the second album, one that doesn&rsquo;t shy away from addressing the other events of those two years-political changes and cultural shifts that have left America and the world stupefied. &ldquo;This has been such an unbelievable time,&rdquo; says Kivlen. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine any artist of our ilk making a record and not have it be seen through the lens of the political climate of 2016 and 2017. So I think there&rsquo;s a few songs on the record that are definitely heavily influenced by this sort of-whatever you want to say what the Trump administration has been.&rdquo; &ldquo;A shit show,&rdquo; offers a helpful Faber.<\/p>\n<p>The resistance is full-throated on Twentytwo in Blue, on tracks like &ldquo;Burn It&rdquo;, a rollicking power pop opener that declares war on the status quo: &ldquo;The street it has my name\/ I burn it to the ground.&rdquo; &ldquo;Crisis Fest&rdquo; is a call to millennial arms, melding pop shimmer and drive with the personal and political. &ldquo;2017-we know\/ Reality&rsquo;s one big sick show\/ Every day&rsquo;s a crisis fest&rdquo;, Cumming sings. There are references to missile tests, &ldquo;80 grand&rdquo; in school debt, and a &ldquo;coup&rdquo; in the country, and an urgent, determined rave-up hook that puts the establishment on notice: &ldquo;If you hold us back, you know that we can shout\/ We brought you into this place\/ You know we can take you out!&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s less a song about Donald Trump than it is about more of a generational divide,&rdquo; says Kivlen. &ldquo;And the ideals of tomorrow and progressive-leaning groups versus people who want things to stay the same or go backwards. It speaks to how our generation are demonized or seen as lazy, when actually we&rsquo;re the most educated. People call us &lsquo;snowflakes&rsquo; because we have sensitive ideals. But being sensitive is a good thing, because we&rsquo;re attuned to people who&rsquo;ve been tread on throughout history.&rdquo;<br \/>&emsp;<br \/>Elsewhere on Twentytwo in Blue, the twangy gem &ldquo;Sinking Sands&rdquo; delves into Kivlen&rsquo;s fascination with alarmist, conspiracy-laden podcasts and where that can lead in the era of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, and marries his droll, Beck-like lead vocal with a dreamy chorus from Cumming. The two share vocals again on &ldquo;Puppet Strings&rdquo; a proper glam rock stomper and sure-fire crowd pleaser in Sunflower Bean&rsquo;s live shows, and on lead single &ldquo;I Was a Fool&rdquo;, released in November along with a darkly funny &ldquo;misfit prom&rdquo; video. And there are even echoes of our ongoing moment of cultural reckoning with generations of sexual harassment and abuse by men in power on &ldquo;Twentytwo&rdquo;, a breezy mid-tempo track with a sweetness that belies the dark truth at its core. &ldquo;Busted and used\/ That&rsquo;s how you view your girl\/ Now that she&rsquo;s 22,&rdquo; sings Cumming, who&rsquo;s not only been part of an emerging young band, but also spent time in the youth-besotted fashion world. A telling line: &ldquo;If I could do it I would take her in my arms\/ I would unwrong all his wrongs.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I want people to feel uncomfortable,&rdquo; comments Cumming about the song. &ldquo;But it is supposed to make you think, about age or being a woman or just the time frame in which you have to do things. And fighting against that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Twentytwo&rdquo; is only one example of a gentler side of Sunflower Bean that&rsquo;s on display on the new album. While the trio remains a guitar band at its core, new and different textures were allowed in this time around. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve figured out in the couple of years since Human Ceremony is I think that we did a lot of the rock stuff, and didn&rsquo;t get much time with the sweeter side,&rdquo; says Faber. &ldquo;And it just kind of felt right to explore this sweeter side and dive deep into that.&rdquo; For the drummer that meant, &ldquo;allowing each element its own space to live and breathe.&rdquo; And for Cumming, that space meant room to truly sing like never before, on the sublime &ldquo;Memoria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Only a Moment&rdquo;, the closest Sunflower Bean has ever come to a ballad. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a rock band, and we would never want to be a ballad-y band,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But also I think when you&rsquo;re like 18 and 19, you need to scream, you know? And in life you&rsquo;ll always need to scream. But I think before I was a little afraid to show myself as a singer, even to my band mates. And in fact they actually welcomed it, and we were able to push ourselves. I think if anything, after making this we&rsquo;re the most well-rounded we&rsquo;ve ever been.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Human Ceremony, essentially a compilation of songs Sunflower Bean had created while still in their teens, over the first two and a half years of the band&rsquo;s life, Twentytwo in Blue was built in a more compact, dedicated time frame. When Kivlen, Faber and Cumming completed a near 200-show world tour on Thanksgiving of 2016, the plan was for the trio to take a well-earned and extended break. But soon enough, the creative juices were flowing. &ldquo;By mid-December we were already back in Jacob&rsquo;s basement on Long Island just working on ideas,&rdquo; recalls Kivlen. Once again, the band collaborated with longtime producer and champion Matt Molnar (Friends) and engineer Jarvis Taveniere (Woods), while new to the creative team this time was Jacob Portrait (Unknown Mortal Orchestra), on board as co-producer and mixer. &ldquo;He and Matt kind of worked hand in hand to take the record to the next level,&rdquo; says Cumming.<br \/>&emsp;<br \/>In three months the &ldquo;bones&rdquo; of the songs were written, and several got live test runs<br \/>in March of 2017, at New York&rsquo;s Terminal 5. Tracking began in early summer, with mixing in early fall-the songs mutating and evolving along the way. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re constantly trying to push ourselves to make something better,&rdquo; explains Faber. &ldquo;And so I think with this we just wanted to dig deep into the songwriting process and really just try to focus on crafting these songs, and building them up. And also having the record just sound really incredible.&rdquo; When all was said and done, says Cumming, &ldquo;It was basically a year-December to December.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>If there was a ragged beauty in the gauzy, groovy wall of sound of Human Ceremony and its predecessor, the 2015 EP Show Me Your Seven Secrets, there&rsquo;s a new directness to these songs, a product of the band&rsquo;s growing maturity and the insanity of the times we&rsquo;re in. Twentytwo in Blue is a record made by millennials in solidarity with their own-the most progressive, even revolutionary generation we&rsquo;ve ever seen. Is it, sonically, a record that suits might call &ldquo;more accessible&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine the band picking up new disciples because of it. But while Sunflower Bean welcome anyone to the party, unlike our president they&rsquo;re not concerned so much with the size of a crowd as with connecting with every person in it. &ldquo;I think one word that always comes to mind when I think about this record is lovable,&rdquo; says Cumming. &ldquo;I think we all really want the record to be lovable. I want the songs to be something that someone can get attached to, and have be a part of them. Because that&rsquo;s what I look for in songs myself, and that&rsquo;s the kind of experience we want to give to others. It&rsquo;s cherished by us, and we just want to share that with people, and communicate that with people.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_SunflowerBean_8_57_31_AM_3_20_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 6:45 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"6:45 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SunflowerBean"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sunflowerbean\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/1xVcjJ5YsYOClO2Unt3Rm8"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sunflower_bean"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.sunflowerbeanband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCFRRTyU9aOXGfAMnBO-Z9TA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:03 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"too-many-zooz":{"id":"3784","name":"Too Many Zooz","friendly_url":"too-many-zooz","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-30","long_dates":"June 30","long_dates_with_day":"Saturday, June 30","description":"<p>At the 2016 CMA Awards one sound burst from the stage like a thunderquake. As Beyonc&eacute; performed \"Daddy Lessons\" accompanied by Dixie Chicks and Too Many Zooz -- the New York City trio which originally recorded the song on the star's&nbsp;<em>Lemonade<\/em>&nbsp;album -- TMZ brought the sound of the street to Beyonc&eacute;'s glittering musical declaration. Glued to their smart phones, tablets, and TVs, America beheld Too Many Zooz' innovative polyglot style.<br \/><br \/>Beyonc&eacute; and Dixie Chicks sashayed the song's verses in a rollicking country vibe, but as the performance neared midpoint, a tall, burly baritone saxophonist with a luminous white pompadour took the stage like a bar-walking gladiator. TMZ's Leo P danced, shimmied, and shaked, matching Beyonc&eacute; move for move, while blowing growling saxophone notes that infused urban funk to \"Daddy Lessons\"' two-beat country jig. TMZ trumpeter Matt Doe and drummer King of Sludge performed on the stage's backline as a blaring brass line raised \"Daddy Lessons\"' intensity, followed by Beyonc&eacute; and Dixie Chicks slamming song's political theme home.<br \/><br \/>Too Many Zooz's saxophonist Pellegrino, trumpeter Matt Doe, and drummer King of Sludge held Nashville's Bridgestone Arena stage for mere minutes, but the same talent that moved Beyonc&eacute; to have the group record both \"Daddy Lessons\" and \"Formation\" on&nbsp;<em>Lemonade<\/em>&nbsp;has seen TMZ sell thousands of CDs and downloads, and inspired viral videos.<br \/><br \/>Too Many Zooz's manic music, dubbed \"BrassHouse\" by drummer King of Sludge, is an irresistible rocket that combines styles more diverse and far-flung than any international space station. As heard on the group's EPs --&nbsp;<em>F NOTE,<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Fanimals, Brasshouse Volume 1: Survival of the Flyest<\/em>,&nbsp;<em>The<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Internet<\/em>, and the LP,&nbsp;<em>Subway<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Gawdz --&nbsp;<\/em>Too Many Zooz creates a visceral smack-to-the-senses. TMZ's BrassHouse summons EDM, house, techno, and glitch, paired to the indigenous punch of Cuban, Afro-Cuban, Caribbean, and Brazilian Carnival rhythms. TMZ's music is further heightened by the dancing and saxophone soloing prowess of Pellegrino, virtually a bionic Pepper Adams. Like Nortec Collective mashed with Daft Punk by way of a mad sonic scientist, Too Many Zooz has conquered New York City -- your headset's resistance is futile.<br \/><br \/>\"We pride ourselves that nearly every person of every color, creed and background and upbringing can find something in our music to relate to,\" Matt Doe says. \"Someone from Cuba can say 'I hear Cuban music in the cowbells.' Someone into death metal will enjoy it next to a grandmother who hears it as old swing music. Others hear Klezmer. Whatever people want to hear in our music they can seemingly find it.\"<br \/><br \/>Many New Yorkers discovered Too Many Zooz at the Union Square subway station, where the trio began busking in 2014. After one of TMZ's videos went viral on Reddit, creating almost a million fans, sales of the band's digital downloads and CD sales skyrocketed.<br \/><br \/>If TMZ's music wasn't already electrifying, Leo Pellegrino's dance moves, which spin like a Zoot-suit wearing swinger, add visual thrills to the band's musical mastery. A classically trained musician, Pellegrino began dancing as both expression and rebellion. What Beyonc&eacute; loved is now available to all.<br \/><br \/>\"Horn players, especially baritone saxophone players, look so lame on stage!\" Pellegrino notes. \"I just watched an NBA half-time show and this band's horn players were killing my eyes. I wondered 'why does the horn have to be such a lame instrument visually?' I began dancing in the subway and people loved it. I realized that I had been brainwashed, all my teachers telling me not to move. I'd been told that was improper technique, but that became my key to success.\"<br \/><br \/>Too Many Zooz's songs are marvels of simplicity born of musical complexity. Pellegrino, Doe, and King of Sludge condense multiple -- what might be considered clashing styles -- into a riveting jackhammer brew. King of Sludge's staccato eighth-note rhythms performed on a unique bass drum\/cowbell\/jamblock\/cymbal setup forms the music's gritty rhythmic bed. Matt Doe's trumpet provides melody and harmony, while Leo Pelligrino's saxophone follows rhythm directions and solo revelry.<br \/><br \/>\"I don't like using standardized terms when describing our music,\" Matt explains. \"We're all doing things that are out of the ordinary. I provide the synth sound you would hear in a dance track. Leo plays saxophone but he's also providing the bass sound you would hear in electronic music. When Leo solos, it's like a breakdown when the bass is the featured element of the band. I don't solo per se, but I am playing nearly the entire show. It doesn't make sense for me to play more!\"<br \/><br \/>TMZ's seeds were formed when Indiana native King of Sludge, and Boston-born Pellegrino played in subway busking band, Drumadics. Fellow Manhattan School of Music classmate and Pittsburgh native Doe played in various ensembles with Pellegrino, the threesome eventually busking together by chance -- their chemistry sparking an instant bond.<br \/><br \/>\"From the start, we were all bouncing off each other, listening to each other and not thinking too much,\" Doe says.<br \/><br \/>TMZ have collaborated with Galatic, Kreayshawn, Jerry \"Wonda\" Duplessis, and, of course, Beyonc&eacute;.<br \/><br \/>\"Knowing that Beyonc&eacute; enjoys our music on her own time?\" ponders King of Sludge. \"That's a great thing.\"<br \/><br \/>What's next for TMZ? The trio's upcoming EP will feature a rawer sound, the group returning to their original roots, and most likely, their original 14th&nbsp;Street subway station.<br \/><br \/>\"When we began, it was just trumpet, saxophone and drums,\" Leo says. \"Our first EP was pretty straight up, then we added production and guests and vocalists on&nbsp;<em>Subway<\/em>&nbsp;<em>Gawdz<\/em>. This next EP is back to our roots.\"<br \/><br \/>Does TMZ recommend the subway path to stardom?<br \/><br \/>\"The subway, then videos and Beyonc&eacute; helped propel our popularity,\" Matt says. \"The subway is a great promotional vehicle. There's nowhere else that you can reach such a wide demographic. If you want to get out and be seen and up your numbers, go to the subway. That's always part of our business plan.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_TooManyZooz_3_53_35_PM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/toomanyzooz"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/toomanyzooz\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/72rZmJbRFSY6IFJAysfOdr"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TooManyZooz"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/toomanyzooz.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCtjXVqMVzBIgU0SO8AV0vPg"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:18:19 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"milck":{"id":"3869","name":"MILCK","friendly_url":"milck","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fight inside MILCK. After a decade of quiet independent releases and tireless gigs around her native Los Angeles, the singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and poet MILCK confidently carried a generational anthem in the form of &ldquo;<strong>Quiet<\/strong>.&rdquo; Originally penned in 2015 with frequent collaborator&nbsp;<strong>Adrianne Gonzalez<\/strong>, the song provided a clarion call for people of all races, creeds, and colors who have suffered and survived gallantly in the face of trauma, trials, and tribulations with resounding piano chords and shuddering, soulful delivery.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable to think now, but I was initially told to hold the song,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t keep compromising anymore though. It&rsquo;s my story as a survivor of abuse. I was finally letting myself out of the chains. Recording &lsquo;Quiet&rsquo; was a very genuine moment of therapy for me. It&rsquo;s very real. I thought if the honesty healed me, maybe it can heal someone else? After the election, I said, &lsquo;Fuck you&rsquo; and shared it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>She shared it in the most beautiful way possible. Traveling to the historic&nbsp;<strong>January 2017 Women&rsquo;s March in Washington, D.C.<\/strong>, MILCK teamed up with 25 female singers&mdash;whom she had never met before&mdash;and delivered seven a cappella flashmob performances of &ldquo;Quiet&rdquo; on the streets. A fan video went viral, racking up over&nbsp;<strong>15 million plays in two days<\/strong>. By the end of the week, she took the stage on&nbsp;<strong>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee<\/strong>&nbsp;for another riveting rendition as&nbsp;<strong>VICE<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>NPR<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Refinery29<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>BuzzFeed<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Associated Press<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Rolling Stone<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Vanity Fair<\/strong>, and more extolled her. It ignited the&nbsp;<strong>#ICantKeepQuiet&nbsp;<\/strong>social media project as everyone from&nbsp;<strong>Emma Watson<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Debra Messing<\/strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Tegan &amp; Sara<\/strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Tom Morello<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Denis Leary<\/strong>&nbsp;shared the video. The initiative&rsquo;s merchandise benefits the&nbsp;<strong>Step Up<\/strong>&nbsp;chapter in L.A., which provides after school and mentorship programs for underprivileged girls 13-18.<\/p>\n<p>Crafting &ldquo;cathartic pop&rdquo; rooted in classical training and inspired by a pastiche of artistic muses ranging from Hemingway and Maya Angelou to modern art, this style defines her debut EP for&nbsp;<strong>Atlantic Records<\/strong>. &ldquo;Throughout all of those years struggling, a major label never felt like it could be a reality,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just being myself, and I don&rsquo;t want to assume that I can sing for everyone. I want to sing what I feel. If people connect, that&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>MILCK has been singing for as long as she can remember. Born to Chinese immigrants in the Los Angeles suburb of Palos Verdes, she enrolled in classical piano at six-years-old and opera classes at the age of eight. Honing her talents during high school, the budding artist headed to Berkeley for college, promising she &ldquo;would try pre-med&rdquo; and allaying some of her doctor father&rsquo;s worries about a potential career in music. Inspired by everything from Fre\u00b4de\u00b4ric Chopin, Tori Amos, and Elton John to Imogen Heap, Portishead, Radiohead, and Massive Attack, she experienced something of an awakening in the college&rsquo;s underground piano rooms.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I realized I could sing and play piano at the same time,&rdquo; she goes on. &ldquo;That opened the door to writing pop songs. I felt like I could finally express myself. I&rsquo;m grateful for my classical foundation. The amazing thing about opera is I learned how to use my vocal cords to sing for hours without getting tired, but rather, becoming stronger. I had all of these tools and decided I would graduate, move to L.A., and get my ass kicked by the music industry.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Performing under her given name,&nbsp;<strong>Connie Lim<\/strong>, she paid her dues tenfold. Throughout the next 8 years, she successfully financed an indie release via Kickstarter and built a sturdy foundation all the while weathering crumbling business partnerships and a series of obstacles. In 2016, she re-emerged under the name MILCK&mdash;her last name Lim spelled backwards and first two initials. &ldquo;I wanted to establish myself, so I did MILCK,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;It uses the name I received from my ancestors, but I&rsquo;m changing it and making it my own, so I can actually be who I am. It&rsquo;s taking accountability.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>She made waves with &ldquo;<strong>Devil Devil,<\/strong>&rdquo; which went on to receive high-profile syncs in&nbsp;<strong>Lucifer<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>The Royals<\/strong>&nbsp;as it racked up nearly&nbsp;<strong>a million Spotify streams<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>over 1 million YouTube views<\/strong>. However, the stark and shuddering, yet disarmingly catchy &ldquo;Quiet&rdquo; finally needed to be heard. &ldquo;I was pretty sad,&rdquo; she remembers. &ldquo;My management disappeared, and I felt like I hit rock bottom. I said to my boyfriend, &lsquo;I lost my team.&rsquo; He looked at me and went, &lsquo;But honey, you are the team.&rsquo; That really shifted my perspective. Shortly after that, I released &lsquo;Quiet.&rsquo; Hemingway wrote, &ldquo;You are so brave and quiet I forget you are suffering.&rdquo; MILCK is quiet no more, and her honesty possesses the power to heal.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather express than impress,&rdquo; she leaves off. &ldquo;When people listen to me, I want them to feel empowered. I want a catharsis. My ideal situation as an artist is to harness my voice so it becomes like the purest form of water. When I sing in a room, I want to wash people and the walls of all the pain and shit they deal with. I come from a family of doctors. Doctors are healers. I want to be a sonic healer.&rdquo;<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MILCK_10_59_18_AM_3_19_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MILCKMUSIC\/"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/milckmusic\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/62lirbb6qJs4VOGpdCNHK8"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MILCKMUSIC"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/milckmusic.com\/splash\/?ref="},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCVOL6yCyx-llAU25lAv45JA"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:25:05 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"little-feather":{"id":"3813","name":"Little Feather","friendly_url":"little-feather","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-27","long_dates":"June 27","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, June 27","description":"<p>Country singer-songwriter Liz Sharpe (a.k.a. Little Feather) literally has music in her blood. From the tiny Appalachian town of Pikeville, Kentucky, she was born into the fabled singing dynasty that includes Loretta Lynn and Patty Loveless, and has been making music practically since she emerged from the womb. After years of singing and playing organ in the church choir she joined forces with her five best musical compadres and found her musical home with the band Little Feather.<\/p>\n<p>Liz, who has sung harmony for such diverse acts as Holly Williams (Hank Williams' Jr.'s daughter) and Michael Bolton, penned a song titled &ldquo;Float Along, Little Feather.&rdquo; Upon listening to her composition, she knew she was onto a certain sound that she wanted to explore more deeply. She and her husband, Aaron Spraggs (drums), recruited Dylan Rowe (bass guitar), Sam Brooker (rhythm guitar and harmony), Shannon Campbell (guitar, mandolin, banjo and harmony, and Glen Campbell&rsquo;s son), and Pat Boyer (guitar and slide), and Little Feather was born. Take one listen to the music of this fresh new band and one thing will become very apparent - there's nobody else like them.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine the sound of Alison Krauss sitting in with Mumford and Sons in Fleetwood Mac's basement and you'll have an idea of Little Feather's sound. The songs on their debut CD, <em>Little Feather<\/em>, run the emotional and stylistic gamut. There&rsquo;s the ebullience of &ldquo;Hillbilly Love Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;ASAP,&rdquo; the romantic yearning of &ldquo;Try Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Touch the Moon,&rdquo; and the air-tight harmonies of &ldquo;Waiting on Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roll River Roll.&rdquo; The ability to craft their own songs is something Liz says Little Feather takes a great degree of pride in. &ldquo;I think it gives us authenticity as a band. There&rsquo;s a truth that runs through it. When we&rsquo;re playing live, we&rsquo;re telling a story that we all wrote together.\"<\/p>\n<p>Little Feather&rsquo;s music comes across so well because of this kinship the band shares. \"We all love spending time together,&rdquo; the band says, &ldquo;We are like musical brothers and sisters, a family. We eat together, drink together, hang out together, and rock the stage together.\"<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can walk into a room right now, play, and it will sound the same as it does when you put it on in your car. We don&rsquo;t want people to go, &lsquo;Man, I paid all this money to see these guys live, and they don&rsquo;t really sing or play like that.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re not always perfect.

A creator. A player of conscience.<\/p>\n<p>The Chicago native may be in the prime of her youth, but her music tells a story as old as the venues she has inhabited. Having graced stages like New York City's Carnegie Hall, Liverpool's own Cavern Club, and most recently the pages of Relix Magazine, she is no stranger to the mystic and magic of captivating an audience. \"Music gives me a soul. I play for one simple reason. It is my life support. Without music, I am just a passerby though.\"<\/p>\n<p>M A L O recently released her debut solo album, <em>Born in a Bad Way<\/em>. The piece is a haunted, self-reflective collection of ethereal, multidimensional tracks&mdash; an authentic snapshot of a creative&rsquo;s attempt to release themselves from apathy as a means of getting by. It was recorded in Brooklyn, NY at Douglass Studios.<\/p>\n<p>\"I admit that I don't have any definitive goals as an artist&mdash; but I have preoccupation with the human condition. Writing music, for me, allows me to indulge that. I play for no other reason than to create something using all of my senses.&nbsp;At the base of our populous, we are all the same being&mdash; that&rsquo;s the head, as they call it in jazz. And then you&rsquo;ve got the personhood of each individual being, and well, that is improvisation. It makes me terribly nervous to not be fully aware of how people resolve when I&rsquo;m watching them listen to my music, but I wouldn&rsquo;t trade that feeling for the world.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>M A L O's debut album, <em>Born in a Bad Way,<\/em>&nbsp;is available at all online retailers now.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_MALO_11_40_48_AM_3_21_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"True","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 5:30 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"5:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/maloplaysmusic"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/maloband\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/4lolNt9AqIBVf8r7GKK951"},{"type":"website","link":"https:\/\/www.mallorylennon.com\/"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/28\/2018 02:24:26 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"alex-guthrie":{"id":"3870","name":"Alex Guthrie","friendly_url":"alex-guthrie","stages":"johnson-controls-world-stage","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-04","long_dates":"July 4","long_dates_with_day":"Wednesday, July 4","description":"<p><strong>Alex Guthrie<\/strong> is a singer-songwriter based in Atlanta.

His interest began at about age six when an older brother gave him a toy magic set. His initial &lsquo;public&rsquo; appearance was at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Center Street Public Library in 1960 for which he was paid $7.50. The repertoire included scarves that magically appeared and cards that changed from one value to another.<\/p>\n<p>David now travels far from his Milwaukee, Wisconsin home and causes women to appear or transform into his tiger, Tara. His Wonders of Magic has been presented in over thirty states, coast-to-coast, and is a lavish production with beautiful settings, spectacular illusions, colorful costuming, and evocative music.<\/p>\n<p>David studied theater at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee where he graduated with honors and a BFA degree. On campus he created a benefit show that ran for ten years. He also briefly taught a course in magic at UW-M.<\/p>\n<p>In 1979 an original musical was written around David called It Must Be Magic. Staged at Milwaukee&rsquo;s Pabst Theatre, it ran for sixty sold-out performances. He is very well known in his home city where he regularly performs for many private functions and at popular public events such as Rainbow Summer, Holiday Folk Fair, County Stadium and State Fair Park doings, and -since 1980- annual twice nightly appearances at Summerfest, the world&rsquo;s largest music festival.<\/p>\n<p>Frequently called upon by major corporations, David has created specialized magical performances for Ford, Oldsmobile, Buick, McDonald&rsquo;s, IBM, General Electric, Sony, Miller Brewing, Mercury Marine, and Walgreen&rsquo;s. In November 1999, he traveled to Antwerp, Belgium to perform for the international sales force of Philips Medical. One year later, in 2000, John Deere invited him to host their new product rollout and host six presentations to their dealers over a three-week period in Florida. &nbsp; In December, 2013 David was invited by Armed Forces Entertainment to fly around the world in eleven days and present shows for our troops overseas. &nbsp;Five appearances were made in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>He combined his love of classical music with magic to create The Maestro &amp; The Magician, a concert attraction that has appeared with notable orchestras in California, Hawaii, Arizona, and Texas as well as with the Buffalo Philharmonic, Syracuse Symphony, and Rochester Orchestra.In the 21st century David has become a frequent guest artist with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.<\/p>\n<p>David&rsquo;s holiday attraction, Merry Magic Christmas, has appeared in New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Hawaii. Seasonal music and magic are blended for this family attraction.<\/p>\n<p>In 1991 David and his staff created Illusions in the Night, perhaps the only elaborate magic and illusion show designed to scare an audience. It has appeared annually in Milwaukee. The show -and its ghosts-has also traveled to upstate Wisconsin and Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>Within his field David Seebach has won honors and high acclaim. He has been a featured performer at the national convention of the Society of American Magicians, the east coast Magic Jubilee, and the annual Magic Get-Together where he has been featured frequently and won the coveted &lsquo;Best of the Best&rsquo; trophy. He has also appeared at Hollywood&rsquo;s famed Magic Castle, long considered a crown jewel in magicdom. His writing was featured monthly in a long-published conjuror&rsquo;s magazine.<\/p>\n<p>He still makes his home in the Milwaukee area when not out on-the-road performing elsewhere.<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_DavidSeebachsWondersofMagic_9_08_24_AM_3_22_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 27 - 8:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 27","start_time":"8:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 29 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 29","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"June 30 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"June 30","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 3 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 3","start_time":"7:30 PM"},{"stage_name":"Northwestern Mutual Children's Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 7:30 PM","stage_id":"northwestern-mutual-childrens-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"7:30 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DavidSeebachMagic"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.davidseebach.com\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"03\/30\/2018 12:04:05 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"33-rpm":{"id":"3908","name":"33 RPM","friendly_url":"33-rpm","stages":"jojos-martini-bar","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 06-29","long_dates":"June 29","long_dates_with_day":"Friday, June 29","description":"<p>33RPM Band is a high energy classic rock band playing some of the best classic &ldquo;album&rdquo; rock ever produced, including a Heart tribute set!

But it was her time in Virginia and Nashville where she found the roots music that would continue to inspire her musical evolution to today.<\/p>\n<p>Her anticipated debut album, \"Good Woman,\" is hauntingly lonesome, with dust-cloud swells of electric guitar and don't-look-back lyrics revealing<\/p>\n<p>scenes from Mancari&rsquo;s well-travelled story. She recalls, &ldquo;I remember being 19, and I would go to this old warehouse where a bunch of old timers would be siting around picking and drinking moonshine&hellip;and we are talking straight up moonshine.\" During this time, Mancari's curiosity to see the world with eager, fresh eyes grew, drawing her to travel and experience all types of people and places. Her travels would inevitably impact her music; since her music is the landscape of all she's seen, &ldquo;Good Woman&rdquo; evokes the sound of city grit and the mountain music of her youth, swirling into a fresh, nostalgic sound.<\/p>\n<p>Mancari explains that she wants her music to be familiar to audiences, but also pushing creative boundaries, rewriting the rules for her genre. She<\/p>\n<p>explains, &ldquo;Our hope is that we&rsquo;re doing something that respects the roots but also has space and the galaxy in it.&rdquo; It's these planetary frontiers, along with the powerful fragility in her voice, that make Mancari's music beyond standard classifications.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps more striking than Mancari&rsquo;s sound is the tender honesty and vulnerability present in each of her songs. Ann Powers describes Mancari&rsquo;s writing as \"lyrical and raw,\" commenting on the \"great personality in her songs.\" As a gay woman in the south, she has fought hard to reconcile her<\/p>\n<p>spiritual beliefs with her sexuality. Her strong personality enables her to be a spokeswoman to the outcast and the misfit, helping her redefine the categories that so often divide people. Mancari explains, &ldquo;It was not an easy road when I came out. No matter how hard I tried to fit into society&rsquo;s molds, I could not. I want to be open and proud of who I am, because I needed people like that in my life when I was young.&rdquo; Mancari hopes that people will find the bravery in her story and be able to discover their own inner strength.<\/p>\n<p>When Mancari sings, she shines with authenticity. It is evident that Mancari knows exactly who she is, and her music has a strong sense of identity. But it is her refusal to subscribe to molds and societies trends that sets Mancari apart. Mancari is challenging all of us to throw away the old book and create a new genre of music.<\/p>\n<p><em>In a short time, Mancari has made a name for herself in Nashville and the southeast. She has toured and played with Margo Price, Hurray For The Riff Raff, The Lone Bellow, SUSTO, Joan Osborne, The Weeks, and more.<\/em><\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_BeccaMancari_2_37_35_PM_3_26_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Johnson Controls World Stage","date_time":"July 6 - 8:00 PM","stage_id":"johnson-controls-world-stage","date":"July 6","start_time":"8:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/5n9jfCRA7AFY1JfYc5ZYK5"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/www.beccamancari.com"},{"type":"ticketmaster","link":"https:\/\/summerfest.com\/ticket-info\/"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/02\/2018 11:47:58 AM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}},"cold-sweat--the-brew-city-horns":{"id":"3916","name":"Cold Sweat & The Brew City Horns","friendly_url":"cold-sweat--the-brew-city-horns","stages":"jojos-martini-bar","dates":"headliner support-and-headliner 07-03","long_dates":"July 3","long_dates_with_day":"Tuesday, July 3","description":"<p>Cold Sweat is Wisconsin&rsquo;s premier show band, featuring some of the area&rsquo;s best musicians, multiple dynamic vocalists and the renowned three piece horn section, the Brew City Horns.

She was on fire. She thought she nailed it. Not quite.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\"I was like, 'I don't know what's up with you,\" recalls Perry (P!nk, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani), who produced, engineered, and co-wrote several tracks on Dorothy's second full-length album, 28 Days in the Valley, for Jay Z's Roc Nation. \"You just made this incredible band sound like fucking shit and there's not one vocal I can keep here. Are you drunk?\"<\/p>\n<p>The singer was up partying until 5 a.m., so when she rolled into the studio at 11 a.m. the effects of the night were on full display. So Perry, who also manages the band, kicked Dorothy out of the studio with this firm warning: \"If you feel you can't do this, tell me now because you're wasting my time. You are better than this. Call your sponsor, go to a meeting, get your shit together because these songs are great and we are going to make a fucking great record.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It was a major turning point, for sure. \"I hit my rock bottom that day,\" admits the Budapest-born, San Diego-raised artist. I sounded like shit. I felt like shit. I looked like shit. I was making my band suck. I was erratic. I was crying. Linda sat me down and handed me my ass.\"<\/p>\n<p>It was the wake-up call the artist needed. It was that of a phoenix rising from the ashes moment. Martin began to look inside for the answers and found the strong, confident, empowered woman that she had been hiding. Not only did she make an evolutionary turn as an individual and artist, but the band - which also includes guitarist Owen Barry, guitarist Leroy Wulfmeier, bassist Eliot Lorango, and drummer Jason Ganberg - made that \"fucking great record\" Perry had hoped for.<\/p>\n<p>\"It was very humbling, but necessary,\" says Martin. \"This was a spiritual journey and very healing, and because of that it's an unapologetically honest record. Somehow Linda knew I had more to give as a singer and writer. I used to hide behind the tough girl sound, but she taught me that there is power in my vulnerability and that's what you get on this record.\"<\/p>\n<p>\"Flawless,\" the first single, is one of those vulnerable songs. The boot-stomping rocker kicks off the 13-track album with the heartbreaking lyrics, \"You said you loved me, but you threw me out in the garbage\/Now I'm starting to stink but everybody thinks I'm flawless,\" but by the end of the song Martin's pain turns to an uplifting feel-good anthem of love as she sings, \"Coming out of all my darkness\/Now that I'm flawless\/ Can you feel it?\/Can you feel it?\"<\/p>\n<p>\"It's about an ex who really did a number on me,\" reveals Martin. \"This one came fast to me. It was very subconscious... like I'm channeling them. Linda pulled the lightness out of me, both personally and musically. This record is definitely still bold, but it's happier. It's kind of like the butterfly coming out of the cocoon, which is why the band logo now is a butterfly.\"<\/p>\n<p>The bluesy rocker, \"Pretty When You're High Boy,\" dives further the emotional rollercoaster of her bad romantic choices. \"We've all dated that beautiful boy who likes the ganja too much. He looks like an angel, but was anything but. It's kind of an ode to those surfer stoner boys and girls of the world. I worked out a lot of stuff on this record,\" she laughs.<\/p>\n<p>Even with more tender moments, 28 Days in the Valley still has the in-your-face bluesy, gritty rock and roll fans loved on 2016's ROCKISDEAD, and their recent standalone single, \"Down To the Bottom,\" which hit No. 35 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and which Rolling Stone called the \"perfect mix of blues thunder and alt-rock guitar crunch.\" But, added to that thunder this time around are more layers of emotion fueled by less metal, more California desert rock vibes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The powerful '60s-tinged \"Who Do You Love\" takes you down the fast lane of psychedelic desert rock perfection, while \"Ain't Our Time To Die\" harkens back to the band's trademark dirty rock sensibilities. The record takes several uplifting turns as heard on \"Mountain,\" \"Freedom,\" and \"White Butterfly\" where it's hard not to feel the spiritual journey and awakening Dorothy has embarked on.<\/p>\n<p>It's the kind of record that has a pulse and beckons to be played live from beginning to end... and there's a good reason for that. \"We recorded the old-school way like the Stones did. After writing, we did a good amount of pre-production and worked out the energy and vibe of the songs and then we went in and recorded live, usually in just a few takes. Nothing on this record is programmed. It's raw and real and honest,\" explains Martin, who led meditation sessions with her band before each session to set the right intention and loving energy.<\/p>\n<p>Coming off an album with as much critical acclaim and fan love as ROCKISDEAD - which hit No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart, No. 5 on Top Hard Rock Albums, and featured two songs (\"Raise Hell\" and \"Dark Nights\") in the Top 40 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart - can be intimidating for most bands going into their sophomore record. Critics compared Martin to some of the greatest female artists of our time, such as Amy Winehouse, Patti Smith, and Grace Slick, even calling her \"a revved up Adele teetering on the brink of chaos.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The praise was equal for the band as Rolling Stone magazine named Dorothy one of the best 50 Best New Artists, while Billboard likened the group's \"Wicked Ones,\" which was featured in Levi's and Gatorade spots, to a blend of Black Sabbath and the White Stripes, and Vice's Noisey dubbed \"After Midnight,\" which featured actress\/model Suki Waterhouse in the music video, \"the perfect modern rock concoction.\"<\/p>\n<p>Those kind of accolades are enough to make any young band shake in their boots. But, not Dorothy.<\/p>\n<p>\"I had no fear coming into this record,\" Martin proudly states. \"We were in capable hands and I finally felt empowered to be even more of a songwriter than I was before. I finally learned to trust my intuition and my heart, and to get out of my head. You know, the main message of this album is to not live in fear; it's to transform everything in your life to be on the frequency of love, which is so powerful and all healing. That's what this record is all about.\"<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/summerfest-live-xefn4c2qjk.stackpathdns.com\/assets\/CenterStage\/PerformerImages\/Performance_Dorothy_2_07_33_PM_4_4_2018.jpg","is_emerging":"False","times":[{"stage_name":"Harley-Davidson Roadhouse","date_time":"July 7 - 6:00 PM","stage_id":"harley-davidson-roadhouse","date":"July 7","start_time":"6:00 PM"}],"socials":[{"type":"facebook","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/itsdorothysucka"},{"type":"instagram","link":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/itsdorothysucka\/"},{"type":"soundcloud","link":"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/6IOvhXyk5edbA2DVaeP9Up"},{"type":"twitter","link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/itsdorothysucka"},{"type":"website","link":"http:\/\/dorothytheband.com\/"},{"type":"youtube","link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/itsdorothysucka"}],"files":[],"updated_at":"04\/05\/2018 02:15:12 PM","stage":{"id":0,"name":""}}}
